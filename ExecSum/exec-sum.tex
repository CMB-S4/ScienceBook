  {\Large \bf Executive Summary}
\end{center}

The next generation ``Stage-4" ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, CMB-S4, consisting of dedicated telescopes equipped with highly sensitive superconducting cameras operating at the South Pole, the high Chilean Atacama plateau, and possibly northern hemisphere sites, will provide a dramatic leap forward in our understanding of the fundamental nature of space and time and the evolution of the Universe. CMB-S4 will be designed to cross critical thresholds in testing inflation, determining the number and masses of the neutrinos, constraining possible new light relic particles, providing precise constraints on the nature of dark energy, and testing general relativity on large scales. 

CMB-S4 is intended to be the definitive ground-based CMB project. It will deliver a highly constraining data set with which any model for the origin of the primordial fluctuations---be it inflation or an alternative theory---and their evolution to the structure seen in the Universe today must be consistent.   
While we have learned a great deal from CMB measurements, including discoveries that have pointed the way to new physics, we have only begun to tap the information encoded in CMB polarization, CMB lensing and other secondary effects.  The discovery space from these and other yet to be imagined effects will be  maximized by designing CMB-S4 to produce high-fidelity maps, which will also ensure enormous legacy value for CMB-S4.



CMB-S4 is the logical successor to the Stage-3 CMB projects which will operate over the next few years. For maximum impact, CMB-S4 should be implemented on a schedule that allows a transition from Stage~3 to Stage~4 that is as seamless and as timely as possible, preserving the expertise in the community and ensuring a continued stream of CMB science results. This timing is also necessary to ensure the optimum synergistic enhancement of the science return from contemporaneous optical surveys (e.g., LSST, DESI, Euclid and WFIRST).   Information learned from the ongoing Stage-3 experiments can be easily incorporated into CMB-S4 with little or no impact on its design. In particular, additional information on the properties of Galactic foregrounds would inform  the detailed distribution of detectors among frequency bands in CMB-S4.  
The sensitivity and fidelity of the multiple band foreground measurements needed to realize the goals of CMB-S4 will be provided by CMB-S4 itself, at frequencies just below and above those of the main CMB channels. 

This timeline is possible because CMB-S4 will use proven existing technology that has been developed and demonstrated by the CMB experimental groups over the last decade. There are, to be sure, considerable technical challenges presented by the required scaling-up of the instrumentation and by the scope and complexity of the data analysis and interpretation.  CMB-S4 will require: scaled-up superconducting detector arrays with well-understood and robust material properties and processing techniques; high-throughput mm-wave telescopes and optics with unprecedented precision and rejection of systematic contamination; full internal characterization of astronomical foreground emission; large cosmological simulations and theoretical modeling with accuracies yet to be achieved; and computational methods for extracting minute correlations in massive, multi-frequency data sets contaminated by noise and a host of known and unknown signals. 


CMB-S4 is well aligned with the plan put forth by the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) report {\it Building for Discovery: Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics in the Global Context}, which recommends ``Support CMB experiments as part of the core particle physics program. The multidisciplinary nature of the science warrants continued multiagency support.''  The P5 justification for this recommendation emphasized, ``These measurements are of central significance to particle physics. Particle physics groups at the DOE laboratories have unique capabilities, e.g., in sensor technology and production of large sensor arrays that are essential to future CMB experiments as the technological sophistication and scale of the experiments expands. The participation of particle physicists in cases in which they contribute unique expertise is warranted. For these reasons, substantially increased particle physics funding of CMB research and projects is appropriate in the context of continued multiagency partnerships.''  The overall project/activity plan of the P5 report has the CMB-S4 project proceeding under all funding scenarios considered.  CMB-S4 is also endorsed as one of only three priority research initiatives in 
the NRC report {\it A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research}. 

CMB measurements are also being proposed with instrumentation on satellites and high-altitude balloons. Compared to ground-based observations, these measurements have the advantage of not having to observe through Earth's absorbing and emitting atmosphere, which causes additional measurement noise (balloon-based measurements suffer only small residual noise).  
To minimize the additive noise, ground-based CMB measurements are pursued at wavelengths within broad atmospheric windows bordered by strong atmospheric absorption lines. Within these windows, the chief source of noise impacting the measurements is emission from temporally and spatially varying water vapor, often referred to as sky noise. This sky noise makes precision measurements on the largest angular scales exceedingly difficult. These are also the angular scales at which the CMB signal is most heavily contaminated by astronomical foreground emission.
Compared to satellite based experiments, however, ground-based measurements have the advantage of deploying large aperture telescopes (diameters of several meters), which are needed to achieve the high angular resolution as dictated by the CMB-S4 science goals. While a large telescope could in principle be launched into orbit at an exorbitant cost, the ground-based measurements have been proven to work well at these angular scales,  are far more economical, and are able to take advantage of the latest technological advances.  

There is therefore a natural synergy for future satellite-based and ground-based measurements. CMB-S4 will make the definitive CMB measurements at angular scales from tens of degrees to arc minutes at wavelengths which straddle the peak of the CMB emission. On the largest angular scales, corresponding at multipoles $\ell < 20$, the definitive measurements will need to be done by a satellite covering a range of wavelengths.  The complementarity of ground and satellite measurements will be particularly important in the search for the signature of inflationary gravitational waves in the CMB polarization, so called B mode polarization, as there should be distinct features at degree angular scales imprinted when the CMB decoupled and at very low multipoles when the universe reionized. 

This Science Book sets the scientific goals for CMB-S4 and the measurements required to achieve them. It thereby provides the basis for proceeding with the detailed experimental design. We now provide summaries of the primary science drivers, observables, and analysis/computing issues, each of which is developed in depth in a dedicated chapter of the book.
