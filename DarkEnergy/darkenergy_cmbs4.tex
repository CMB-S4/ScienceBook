\section{Introduction}

The enigma of cosmic acceleration is among the most challenging problems in physics. Our most basic understanding about gravity -- that objects fall towards one and other under mutual gravitational attraction -- simply does not apply on the largest distance scales. Instead, gravity is apparently repulsive at large distances and late times; the scale of spacetime itself is currently not only expanding but accelerating. The implication is either that our understanding of gravity is incomplete, or some other causative agent -- dark energy -- with exotic gravitational properties fills the universe. In both cases, new physics is required beyond the four fundamental forces described by the Standard Model and general relativity.

The working hypothesis is that the cosmic acceleration is due to an exquisitely small cosmological constant, that Einstein's general relativity is valid from millimeter to beyond gigaparsec scales, and that dark matter consists of a single species of a cold, collisionless particle. Yet none of these offer insight or reflect the unity of physics demonstrated elsewhere as in the Standard Model of particle physics.

For example, the cosmological constant suffers from a naturalness problem whose resolution may lie in a dynamical dark energy, quintessence. Theories of quintessence posit a new scalar field and predict a variety of testable phenomena.  They can also provide new links to dark matter, neutrino physics, cosmic parity violation. In their most general form, they represent
a scalar-tensor theory of gravity which can be described by  the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy and modified gravity in the linear regime. 
CMB S4 can provide the hard evidence is needed to pare down these possibilities.

The current observational evidence suggests a new frontier for physics at low energies and weak coupling, implied by the cosmological scales that characterize dark energy. The cosmic microwave background is an ideal arena to search for clues to these new laws of physics. A stage IV CMB experiment would be capable, as described in this chapter, of helping to answer basic questions about dark energy and gravity in a manner complementary to measurements of the expansion history.  CMB lensing, thermal SZ cluster counts and mass measurements, and the kinematic SZ effect are all measure the influence of cosmic acceleration on the growth of 
structure.   % and dark matter (restore later if we merge).

\section{Models and parameters}

(start with cc and falsification, move to w0-wa / smooth DE, various splits of growth v distance, EFT of scalar-tensor theories)


CMB-S4 will open new windows on the dark sector of our universe. By combining its power as a geometrical probe with high quality measurements of inhomogeneities CMB-S4 will allow us to study the origin of cosmic acceleration and the nature of the gravitational interaction. In this section, we shall briefly review the frameworks that have been proposed over the past years to perform parametric tests of Dark Energy and Gravity models. Such approaches represent the only viable option to explore the space of models beyond the fiducial one, in the absence of theoretically compelling alternatives. Different parametrizations place constraints on classes of models, rather than specific ones, allowing to phrase the knowledge gained through experiments in a model independent way. \\
Several parametrizations have been proposed in the literature and they can be separated into three families: ``trigger'' parametrizations, equation of motion parametrizations and theory parametrizations. The first ones are directly derived from observations and are designed to detect a breakdown of the standard model. They are usually simple and very close to observations. As a drawback their consistency with GR does not rule out alternatives and the value of the ``trigger'' parameters does not necessarily have a physical meaning.

\item Description of the growth index (first forecast possible on a month timescale);
\item $E_{G}$ (no forecast here on a short time scale);
\item Discuss the observational status of these parametrizations;
\item Discuss critical/natural threshold;
\end{itemize}
%
The second way of parametrizing deviations from the fiducial scenario consists in modifying its equations of motion. The resulting parametrizations are general and sensitive to phenomenological signatures for which we might not have an appropriate theoretical description. For these reason they are very convenient to extract information about Dark Energy and Gravity from data but the lack of a strong contact with theories makes these information hard to interpret. Several of these frameworks have been developed over the years to describe, in a general way, the behavior of the cosmological background and the growth of perturbations.

\item Details and definitions of background parametrizations ($w_{DE}$) (w0wa DETF FoM, first forecast possible in 1 or 2 weeks timescale);
\item Details and definitions of scalar perturbation parametrizations ($\mu$, $\gamma$, $\Sigma$, PPF, ...?) (first forecast on some of these on a month timescale); 
\item Details and definitions of tensor perturbation parametrizations ($c_T$) (first forecast possible in 1 or 2 weeks timescale);
\item Discuss the observational status of these parametrizations;
\item Discuss critical/natural threshold;
\end{itemize}
%
The last way of performing parametric studies of deviations from the fiducial model consists in directly parametrizing theories beyond it. This approach maintains a strong connection with the underlying theory simplifying the theoretical interpretation of data. This framework can be developed through an ÔeffectiveÕ approach, inspired by the effective field theory for inflation~\cite{Creminelli:2006xe,Cheung:2007st,Weinberg:2008hq,Creminelli:2008wc,Park:2010cw,Jimenez:2011nn} to describe the cosmological phenomenology of all universally coupled single scalar field Dark Energy and Gravity models. Specifically, the effective field theory (EFT) of cosmic acceleration~\cite{Gubitosi:2012hu,Bloomfield:2012ff} describes the space of these models with an action written in a unitary gauge that preserves isotropy and homogeneity of the cosmological background and reads:
%
\begin{eqnarray} \label{Eq:EFTaction}
\mathcal{S}_{\rm EFT} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}&& \bigg\{ \frac{m_0^2}{2} \left[1+\Omega(\tau)\right] R + \Lambda(\tau) - c(\tau)\,a^2\delta g^{00} + \frac{M_2^4 (\tau)}{2} \left( a^2\delta g^{00} \right)^2 \nonumber \\ 
&&   - \frac{\bar{M}_1^3 (\tau)}{2} \, a^2\delta g^{00}\,\delta K{^\mu_{\,\,\mu}}  - \frac{\bar{M}_2^2 (\tau)}{2} \left( \delta {K}{^\mu_{\,\,\mu}}\right)^2   - \frac{\bar{M}_3^2 (\tau)}{2} \,\delta {K}{^\mu_{\,\,\nu}}\,\delta {K}{^\nu_{\,\,\mu}} \nonumber \\
&& + m_2^2(\tau)\left(g^{\mu\nu}+n^{\mu} n^{\nu}\right)\partial_{\mu}(a^2g^{00})\partial_{\nu}(a^2g^{00}) +\frac{\hat{M}^2(\tau)}{2} \, a^2 \delta g^{00}\,\delta \mathcal{R}+	\ldots \bigg\}  \nonumber \\
&& + S_{m} [g_{\mu \nu}, \chi_m ]
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $R$ is the four-dimensional Ricci scalar, $\delta g^{00}$, $\delta K{^\mu_{\,\,\nu}}$, $\delta K{^\mu_{\,\,\mu}}$ and  $\delta \mathcal{R}$ are, respectively, the perturbations of the upper time-time component of the metric, the extrinsic curvature and its trace and the three dimensional spatial Ricci scalar of constant-time hypersurfaces. Finally,  $S_m$ denotes the action for all the matter fields conventionally considered in cosmology. In the action (\ref{Eq:EFTaction}), the  extra scalar degree of freedom is hidden inside metric perturbations. To study the dynamics of linear perturbations, however, it is convenient to make it explicit by means of  the St\"{u}ckelberg technique i.e. performing an infinitesimal coordinate transformation such that $\tau\rightarrow \tau+\pi$, where the field $\pi$ describes the extra propagating degree of freedom. This approach allows us to maintain a direct link to the underlying theory so that we can keep under control its theoretical viability while exploring the cosmological implications of any of the models included in this language~\cite{Raveri:2014cka}. Since the choice of the unitary gauge breaks time diffeomorphism invariance, each operator allowed by the residual symmetry, in action (\ref{Eq:EFTaction}), can be multiplied by a time-dependent coefficient that we shall call EFT function. To fully specify the phenomenology of linear perturbations only a restricted set of EFT functions are needed. These can be either parametrized to explore agnostically the space of Dark Energy and Gravity models~\cite{Gleyzes:2013ooa,Bloomfield:2013efa,Piazza:2013coa,Gleyzes:2014rba} or can be fixed to reproduce exactly the phenomenology of some model of interest such as $f(R)$ gravity, quintessence and, more generally, the Horndeski class of theories and beyond~\cite{Gleyzes:2014dya,Frusciante:2015maa,Frusciante:2016xoj}.

\section{CMB  Dark Energy Observables}

\subsection{Cluster abundance and mass}

Clusters of galaxies are sensitive to the content, geometry, and growth of structure in the universe.  
Clusters of galaxies are the most massive ($\sim$10$^{14}$-10$^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$) objects in the universe to have underwent gravitational collapse, 
having formed from regions $\sim$10-40 Mpc.  This property makes clusters representative of the overall content of the universe, and also makes them 
important tracers of the evolution of large-scale structure, sampling the most extreme peaks in the large-scale matter distribution.  
These properties have enabled clusters to make important contributions to cosmology: the discovery of dark matter in the 
Coma cluster \cite{1933AcHPh...6..110Z}, 
providing early evidence for $\Omega_m < 1$ \cite{white93a, Donahue98, Bahcall98}, and
constraining the physical nature of dark matter \cite{Clowe06}.  
More recently, measurements of clusters have been used to constrain the properties of dark energy and modifications 
to gravity \cite{vikhlinin09, mantz10a, rapetti13, benson13, mantz14, mantz15}.   In the future era of ``Stage IV'' dark energy 
facilities such as DESI and LSST, measurements of the abundance of galaxy clusters can make complementary and 
competitive constraints on the dark energy equation of state and deviations from General Relativity \cite{weinberg13}.  

CMB measurements find clusters through the inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons off of intra-cluster gas, otherwise 
known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect \cite{sunyaev72}. SZ cluster surveys have two important advantages: 
the SZ surface brightness is redshift independent, and the integrated SZ signal is expected to be a relatively 
low-scatter cluster observable \cite{nagai06, nagai07, kravtsov12}.  These properties enable SZ surveys to provide 
relatively clean, mass-limited cluster catalogs out to high-redshift ($z > 1$).  Since the first SZ-discovered clusters were 
report in 2009 \cite{staniszewski09}, SZ surveys have produced catalogs of over 1000 SZ-selected clusters extending out to $z \sim 1.7$ 
\cite{vanderlinde10, reichardt13, hasselfield13, planck13-29, bleem15b, planck15-32}.  


\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{(Left) The 50\% mass-completeness limits for three possible CMB-S4 instrumental configurations with either 1, 2, or 3 arc minute angular resolution.  For comparison, this can be compared with existing SZ-selected cluster catalogs from Planck \cite{planck15-32}, SPT-SZ \cite{bleem15b}, and ACT \cite{hasselfield13}, and future thresholds expected for the optical Dark Energy Survey and the X-ray eRosita survey \cite{pillepich12}.

\label{fig:cluster_counts}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 


With sufficient angular resolution, CMB-S4 opens tremendous possibilities for measuring cluster, more generally halo masses through CMB lensing.  This is essential in particular for using cluster counts as a probe of dark energy and modified gravity.  Figure XX shows an estimate of the mass sensitivity, expressed as the one-sigma mass uncertainty as a function of redshift, for two possible S4 configurations and compares them to planned CMB experiments. 
	The estimation is made assuming foreground subtraction to reach the quoted CMB map noise level at the given angular resolution.  The method (Melin \& Bartlett 2015) employs an optimal filter matched to the NFW profile and applied to reconstructions of the lensing potential with a quadratic estimator (Hu \& Okamoto 2002).  The method has already been successfully applied to the Planck cluster cosmology sample of more than 400 objects (Planck Collaboration XXIV 2015).  This figure shows the sensitivity obtained with just CMB temperature lensing reconstruction.  Including polarization will significantly improve it.  
	We see that the mass sensitivity remains flat with redshift, a remarkable property that enables mass estimation out to redshifts unreachable with galaxy shear measurements.  This is a powerful and unique capability of CMB lensing.  The figure also demonstrates the important gains attained with high angular resolution.  At one arcmin resolution, S4 achieves a mass sensitivity of 2e13 solar masses with temperature alone.  This unprecedented sensitivity not only ensures robust mass estimation for cluster cosmology over the large redshift interval where S4 will detect clusters through the SZ effect, but also paves the way to numerous cluster and large-scale structure studies.  The rapidly increasing science reach enabled by high angular resolution, approaching one arcmin, is an important consideration in S4 objectives.

\subsection{Kinematic SZ}

% Edited by F. de Bernardis
CMB-S4 will map with unprecedented precision the momentum field of the large scale structure via measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Multi-frequency data can be used to remove other foregrounds and isolate the kSZ signal. CMB-S4 measurements with sufficient angular resolution can be used to reconstruct the diffuse kSZ anisotropy signal enabling sub-percent precision measurements of the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations $\sigma_8$ (see for example \cite{Calabrese:2014gwa}) while measurements of the patchy kSZ can place strong constraints on the time and duration of reionization.\\
The combination of CMB-S4 with data from galaxy surveys will be able to measure the kSZ effect associated with galaxy clusters, which is proportional to their peculiar momentum. The large scale structure momentum field is an important cosmological observable that can place strong constraints on the cosmological parameters \cite{Bhattacharya:2007sk,Kosowsky:2009nc,Mueller:2014nsa,Mueller:2014dba} complementary to density fluctuations field measurements. The mean pairwise velocity of galaxy clusters is sensitive to both the growth of structure and the expansion history of the universe and it is an excellent probe for gravity on large scales. Being a differential measurement it is also particularly stable against residual foregrounds that might survive the frequency cleaning process. In \cite{Mueller:2014nsa,Mueller:2014dba} it has been shown that a S4 survey with high resolution can constrain the redshift dependent growth of structure at $\lesssim 5\%$ precision in generic models allowing also for a redshift dependent equation of state of the dark energy. These measurements will be able to distinguish dark energy from modified gravity and will provide complementary constraints to redshift space distortions and weak lensing measurements, probing larger physical scales.\\kSZ pairwise measurements can also constrain the sum of neutrino masses $M_{\nu}= \sum m_{\nu}$ with a $1\sigma$ uncertainty of $0.030 eV$ for a $1$ arcmin S4 overlapping 10000 sq. degrees with a galaxy survey able to identify $M>10^{13}M_{\odot}$ clusters. With a 5 arcmin resolution separating the CMB background from the kSZ signal would be more difficult, providing  $\sigma_{M_{\nu}} = 0.076 eV$ (de Bernardis et al., in preparation). These forecasts include only priors on the 6 standard cosmological parameters from Planck temperatures data and show the potential of the kSZ pairwise signal to provide constraints on the neutrino mass.

\chapter{Dark Matter}
%  currently spit off into its own chapter we may remerge them when sections are more complete


We have learned from many different experiments (weak and strong lensing, studies of the Bullet Cluster, the Cosmic Microwave Background, etc) that approximately $84\%$ of all the matter in the universe is composed of dark matter, which is not accounted for by the Standard Model of particles. However, the particle nature of dark matter remains unknown.

There are various types of experiments trying to shed light on this question: direct detection experiments, indirect detection experiments, and collider experiments. 
An alternative observable where Dark Matter interactions can modify the Standard Model prediction is the CMB power spectrum.
CMB-Stage IV will have the sensitivity to detect new cosmological signatures originating from various types of dark matter interaction. In the sections below, we will discuss some of these possible scenarios.

\subsection{Dark Matter Annihilation}

One of the leading candidates for dark matter are the Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs). If dark matter consists of WIMPs, we would expect these particles to self-annihilate. The annihilation of dark matter produces a shower of very energetic particles, that injects energy into the universe, ionizing the matter in it.

This extra source of ionization has distinctive effects on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): it suppresses the CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations at small angular scales, and it enhances the CMB polarization fluctuations at large angular scales due to the extra scattering of photons off free electrons \cite{Chen:2003gz,Padmanabhan:2005es}.
CMB temperature and polarization spectra can constrain the parameter
$p_{\rm ann}=f\langle\sigma v\rangle/m_{\rm DM}$, where $f$ is the fraction of energy
deposited into the plasma, $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ is velocity-weighted
cross section, and $m_{\rm DM}$ is the mass of the DM particle.
Current constraints coming from WMAP 9-year data,
Planck, ACT, SPT, BAO, HST and SN data excluded
Dark Matter masses below $26$ GeV at the 2$\sigma$ level, assuming that
all the energy is deposited in the plasma \cite{Madhavacheril:2013cna}. CMB-Stage IV is expected to tighten these constraints by a factor of $10$ \cite{Wu:2014hta}. Dark-matter annihilation also leads to growing ionization fraction perturbations and amplified small-scale cosmological perturbations, leaving an imprint on the CMB bispectrum \cite{Dvorkin:2013cga}.

\subsection{Non-Standard Dark Matter Physics}

Near the epoch of CMB last scattering, dark matter (DM) accounts for about $65\%$ of the energy budget of the Universe, hence making the CMB a particularly good probe of potential new physics in the DM sector. Of particular relevance to CMB studies, the presence of new DM interactions with light degrees of freedom \cite{Goldberg:1986nk,1992ApJ...398...43C,1992ApJ...398..407G,1994ApJ...431...41M,1995ApJ...452..495D,AtrioBarandela:1996ur,Green:2005fa,Profumo:2006bv,Bringmann:2009vf,Boehm:2001hm,Mangano:2006mp,Serra:2009uu,McDermott:2010pa,Aarssen:2012fx,Wilkinson:2013kia,Wilkinson:2014ksa,Dvorkin:2013cea,Boehm:2014vja,Escudero:2015yka,Foot:2004pa,Ackerman:2008gi, ArkaniHamed:2008qn,Feng:2009mn,Kaplan:2009de,Behbahani:2010xa,Kaplan:2011yj,Aarssen:2012fx,Cline:2012is,Hooper:2012cw,Das:2012aa,Cyr-Racine:2013ab,Diamanti:2012tg,Baldi:2012ua,Fan:2013yva,Fan:2013tia,McCullough:2013jma,Cyr-Racine:2013fsa,Cline:2013pca,Cline:2013zca,Bringmann:2013vra,Chu:2014lja,Archidiacono:2014nda,Randall:2014kta,Buen-Abad:2015ova,Lesgourgues:2015wza,Choquette:2015mca} can leave subtle imprints on the temperature and polarization CMB power spectra. The introduction of such non-minimal DM models has been primarily (but not exclusively) motivated in the literature by potential shortcomings of the standard cold DM scenario at small sub-galactic scales \cite{deBlok:1997zlw,Klypin:1999uc,Moore:1999aa,Zavala:2009ms,Oh:2010ea,BoylanKolchin:2011de,Papastergis:2011xe,Walker:2011zu,Pawlowski01112013,Klypin:2014ira,Oman:2015xda,Papastergis2015de}. While these issues are far from settled, they motivate the search for other non-minimal DM signatures in complementary data sets (such as the CMB) that could indicate whether or not DM can be part of the solution. In addition, DM interacting with light (or massless) dark radiation (DR) has been put forward \cite{Buen-Abad:2015ova,Lesgourgues:2015wza} has a potential solution to the small discrepancy between the amplitude of matter fluctuations inferred from CMB measurements and those inferred from cluster number counts and weak lensing measurements. As we discuss below, CMB-S4 measurements of the CMB lensing and the lensed B-mode power spectra have the potential to significantly improve constraints on DM interacting with light degrees of freedom in the early Universe.

The key equations governing the evolution of cosmological fluctuations for this broad class of non-minimal DM models are presented in Ref.~\cite{Cyr-Racine:2015ihg}. Essentially, the new DM physics enters entirely through the introduction of DM and DR opacities, which, similarly to the photon-baryon case, prohibit DR free-streaming at early times and provides a pressure term that opposes the gravitational growth of DM density fluctuations. The impact of this new physics on CMB fluctuations has been studied in detail in Ref.~\cite{Cyr-Racine:2013fsa} and we briefly review it here. First, the presence of extra DR mimics the presence of extra neutrino species and affects the expansion history of the Universe, possibly modifying the epoch of matter-radiation equality, the CMB Silk damping tail, and the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. However, unlike standard free-streaming neutrinos, the DR forms a tightly-coupled fluid at early times, leading to distinct signatures on CMB fluctuations which include a phase and amplitude shift of the acoustic peaks (see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Bashinsky:2003tk,Cyr-Racine:2013jua,Follin:2015hya}). Second, the DR pressure prohibits the growth of interacting DM fluctuations on length scales entering the causal horizon before the epoch of DM kinematic decoupling. This weakens the depth of gravitational potential fluctuations on these scales, hence affecting the source term of CMB temperature fluctuations. Finally, the modified matter clustering in the Universe due to nonstandard DM properties will affect the lensing of the CMB as it travel from the last-scattering surface to us.

{\bf CD: More comments:

- At what ell does the DR mainly affect the CMB?

- How important is the effect on the B-mode lensing? Could you be a bit more quantitative here?

- How relevant would it be for CMB-S4? You should think about a full-sky experiment with 1-4 arcmins beam and a detector noise of DeltaP~0.5-1 muK-arcmin.

- How big is the degeneracy expected to be with neutrino mass?

- Mention that these DM constraints are a lot more sensitive to $\ell_{\rm max}$ than $\ell_{\rm min}$.}

{\bf Briefly discuss the possible degeneracy between the impact of interacting DM and massive neutrinos on the matter power spectrum.}

\subsection{Ultralight axions}

Here is the updated text and I've made changes to the .bib file to include those references.

Ultralight axions (ULAs) with masses in the range $10^{-33}~{\rm eV}\leq m_{a}\leq 10^{-20}~{\rm eV}$ are well motivated by string theory, can contribute to either the dark matter or dark energy components of the Universe, depending on their masses, and are distinguishable from DE and CDM in cosmological observables. The current best constraints from the primary CMB TT power, and WiggleZ galaxy redshift survey were made in \cite{hlozek:2015axa}.

The degeneracies of the axions with other cosmological parameters, such as $N_\mathrm{eff}$ or neutrino mass $\sigma$ $m_\nu$ vary depending on the axion mass assumed. Dark energy-like axions with masses around $10^{-33}~{\rm eV}$ change the late-time expansion rate and therefore the sound horizon, changing the location of the acoustic peaks. This has degeneracies with the matter and curvature content.
 Axions that behave more like dark matter (for masses around $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-26}~{\rm eV}$) start oscillating in the radiation era and reduce the angular scale of the diffusion distance, leading to a boost in the higher acoustic peaks, which has a degeneracy with $N_{eff}$.
 In both of these cases, improved errors on the temperature and polarization power spectrum, coupled with constraints on the Hubble constant (for the lightest axions) from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, lead to improvements in the error on allowed axion energy density of a factor of three.
In the matter power spectrum, and thus CMB lensing power, light axions suppress clustering power, suggesting a degeneracy with effects of massive neutrinos that must be broken to make an unambiguous measurement of neutrino mass using the CMB. The above mentioned effects in the expansion rate likely break this degeneracy.
 
 Adding in information from the lensing reconstruction using S4 will improve constraints on axion DM significantly, and allow one to break the degeneracy between dark-matter like axions and massive neutrinos. A percent-level measurement of the lensing deflection power at multipoles L $>$ 1000 leads to an improvement in the error on the axion energy density of a factor of eight relative to the current Planck constraints, for an axion mass of $m_a=10^{-26}~{\rm eV}$. Furthermore, S4 will improve the maximum axion mass constrainable by the CMB by up to two orders of mangitude from $m_a=10^{-24}~{\rm eV}$ to $m_a=10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$. Achieving this improvement in the mass constraint will require improved understanding of non-linear clustering of axions. If realized it will begin to make contact to the preferred axion model to solve the CDM small scale crises \cite{hu:00a, marsh:2013js}.
