%  This is the driver file for the CMB-S4 Science Book.

%%% it has been adapted from the Snowmass reports from the Cosmic Frontier  %%%%
%%% Working Groups to use bibtex. 19Sep15, T. Crawford (orig. 5/13/13 J. Feng) %%%%

%  D. Hitlin   9/23/03   derived from the BABAR Physics Book format

%  To use LATEX with this format, you must have the follwing files 
%  in the same directory as your text source and figure files
%  tcibook.cls
%  fancyhea.sty
%  work.sty
%  epsfig.sty
%  workshopsym.tex       This file provides macros for many common symbols
%                         Using these macros will provide uniformity of notation
%                         for the basic particle symbols, units, etc.
%
%  These provide the page size, type style, headings, etc.
