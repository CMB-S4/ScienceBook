\section{Introduction}

Overview of simulations and data analysis elements motivating the subsequent division into 5 blocks.

\subsection{Data Analysis}

A sequence of S/N enhancing data compressions via domain transformations - time samples (red) to sky pixels (blue) to map multipoles (green) to physical parameters (yellow).

An iterative process, with each domain exposing different systematic effects to be mitigated.

A full analysis requires propogating not just the data but also their covariance between domains. The size of the full pixel covariance now precludes exact methods except in certain special cases.

\subsection{Simulation}

Needed for 
\begin{itemize}
\item Mission design and development (both instrument and observation)
\item Validation and verification of analysis tools
\item Absent a full covariance matrix, Monte Carlo based uncertainty quantification and debiasing.
\end{itemize}

From top to bottom, there is an inevitable trade-off between the computational cost of generating the simulation and its realism and accuracy.

\subsection{Coupling Simulation and Data Analysis}

The overall simulation and data analysis pipeline runs both as a top-down data reduction and a wrap-around refinement of mission and sky characterization and modeling.

It can be subdivided into 5 blocks based on the challenges faced and expertise required to address them.

\section{Forecasting}

Key challenges: 
\begin{itemize}
\item capturing sufficient complexity in multipole-domain sky and mission models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Sky Modeling}

Key challenges: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item reliability of models based on noisy, bandpassed, beam-convolved observations, including Planck
\item self-consistency of CMB secondaries and extra-Galactic foregrounds
\item usability/software engineering
\end{itemize}

\section{Time-Ordered Data Processing}

Key challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item computational tractability due to data volume and complexity of next-generation supercomputers
\item mitigating raw data systematics and developing sufficient mission and data models
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Component Separation}

Key challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item validation - are we using the right algorithms for the (as yet unknown) real foregrounds
\item verification - are these algorithms right given our (as yet flawed) simulations
\end{itemize}

\section{Statistics and Parameters}

Key challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item are our approximations to the full data covariance sufficient?
\end{itemize}
