%%%%%% CMB-S4 Simulations and Data Analysis Chapter, Component Separation Section  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Component Separation}

Key challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item validation - are we using the right algorithms for the (as yet unknown) real foregrounds
\item verification - are these algorithms right given our (as yet flawed) simulations
\end{itemize}
