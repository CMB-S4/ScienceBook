\section{Introduction}
The study of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background will bring additional information about both the gravitational and matter sectors of the primordial universe. However, for primordial gravitational waves there are clear theoretical thresholds that can be reached with this next generation instrument. We will use the tensor-to-scalar ratio as the primary inflationary science driver for the design.

CMB-S4 can push the constraint on $r$ (the ratio of power in tensor modes to power in scalar modes) nearly two orders of magnitude below the current bound.  A detection of primordial gravitational waves in the range accessible to this instrument would:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Reveal a new scale of particle physics far above those accessible with terrestrial particle colliders.  
\item  Rule out the only currently developed competitor to inflation (ekpyrotic scenario)
\end{itemize}
With complementary observations of the statistics of the scalar fluctuations (showing conclusively that the detected signal is dominated by vacuum fluctuations) a detection will also
\begin{itemize}
 \item Identify the energy scale of inflation. 
 \item Provide strong evidence that the complete theory of quantum gravity must accommodate a Planckian field range for the inflaton.
 \item Provide strong evidence for that gravity is quantized, at least at the linear level.
\item  Constrain the mass of the graviton
\end{itemize}
In the absence of a detection, each factor of 10 improvement beyond the current constraint will reach new and significant thresholds, ruling out major classes of inflation models. 

In Section \ref{sec:detection} we review in detail what a detection of primordial gravitational waves would mean. Section \ref{sec:upperLimits} explains why, in the absence of a detection, a robust upper limit of $r<0.001$ is the interesting number to push for. Section \ref{sec:needs} lays out what is required to achieve that goal. The final two sections describe the significant gains CMB S4 will allow in constraining other aspects of the primordial universe, both standard and more speculative. These include characterizing the scalar power spectrum, constraining curvature, non-Gaussianity, and isocurvature modes, further probes of CMB `anomalies' and test/constraints of cosmic strings, mass of the graviton, cosmic birefringence, parity violation....?

\section{Implications of a detection of primordial gravitational waves with CMB-S4}
\label{sec:detection}
The overall evolution of the universe is well modeled by a Friedmann-Robertson-LeMaitre-Walker metric: $g_{\mu\nu}=-dt^2+a^2(t)[\frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2}+r^2d\Omega^2]$ where $k=\pm1$ allows for curvature and the time evolution is specified by the scale factor, $a(t)$. For much of the rest of the discussion we will assume spatial flatness ($k=0$) because it is consistent with all current data, but we will return to constraints on the curvature in Section xxx. The Hubble parameter, $H=\dot{a}/a$, gives the rate of expansion of the universe. 

Arguably the most significant discrepancy between the predictions of a generic hot big bang model and our observed sky is the horizon problem: the measured average CMB temperature and the statistics of the measured anisotropies are the same over regions that share no causal history. Models for the primordial universe attempt to give a causal (and ideally also a `natural') explanation for the observed homogeneity on scales greater than a few degrees by postulating an early era where the co-moving Hubble radius, $(a|H|)^{-1}$ is decreasing with time. In an expanding universe this requires an era of accelerated expansion, $\ddot{a}>0$, inflation puts. The matter field that sources this expansion should have equation of state $w\approx -1$, which is minimally provided by a single scalar field whose energy density is predominately determined by its potential.

The remarkable feature of inflation is that once an evolving scalar field is invoked to source the background accelerated expansion, quantum fluctuations during inflation inevitably generate post-inflationary metric perturbations. The perturbed metric can be described in the ADM formalism by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:metric}
ds^2&=&-N^2dt^2 +h_{ij}(dx^i+N^idt)(dx^j+N^jdt)\nonumber\\
h_{ij}&=&a^2(t)[e^{2\zeta}\delta_{ij}+\gamma_{ij}]
\end{eqnarray}
Here the equations of motion for $N$ (the lapse) and $N^i$ (the shift) are the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, while $\zeta$ ($=-\mathcal{R}$ of {\it Planck convention}) and $\gamma_{ij}$ contain the dynamical scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. (In scenarios with matter sources other than a scalar field there may also be vector perturbations. These are generally irrelevant unless they are being actively sourced by, eg, cosmic strings in the post-inflationary universe. 

The link between the CMB and other tracers of primordial inhomogeneities and the primordial era is a statistical representation of the metric fluctuations after inflation and reheating. Observations today constrain these parameters at early times, which we can compare to calculations from any theory for the primordial era (and reheating). To an excellent approximation, the observed scalar fluctuations are statistically homogeneous, isotropic, and Gaussian so they are well characterized by a power spectrum that is only a function of wavenumber $|\vec{k}|$. Assuming that the same is true for any tensor fluctuations (as is predicted by inflation), we characterize the amplitude and scale dependence of fluctuations by

\begin{eqnarray}
\langle\zeta(\vec{k})\zeta(\vec{k}^{\prime})\rangle&=&(2\pi)^3\delta^3(\vec{k}+\vec{k}^{\prime})\frac{2\pi^2}{k^3}\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)\nonumber\\
\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)&\equiv& A_s\left(\frac{k}{k_*}\right)^{n_s-1+\frac{1}{2}(dn_s/d\,\ln k)\ln(k/k_*)+\dots}\nonumber\\
\langle\gamma_s(\vec{k})\gamma_{s^{\prime}}(\vec{k}^{\prime})\rangle&=&(2\pi)^3\delta_{ss^{\prime}}\delta^3(\vec{k}+\vec{k}^{\prime})\frac{2\pi^2}{k^3}\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{P}_{t}(k)\nonumber\\
\mathcal{P}_{t}(k)&\equiv& A_t \left(\frac{k}{k_*}\right)^{n_t+\frac{1}{2}(dn_t/d\,\ln k)\ln(k/k_*)+\dots}
\end{eqnarray}
where the factor of $1/2$ in the second to last line accounts for the fact that the measured power includes contributions from each of the two graviton polarizations. 
The tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$ is the relative power in the two types of fluctuations at a chosen pivot scale $k_*$ accessible by the CMB:
\begin{equation}
r=\frac{P_T(k_*)}{P_{\zeta}(k_*)}
\end{equation}

During inflation, all fields that are light compared to the Hubble scale pick up quantum fluctuations with rms amplitude proportional to $H/2\pi$. In particular, in the absence of any additional sources, the tensor power spectrum generated by inflation is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inf_Pt}
\mathcal{P}_{t}(k)=\frac{8}{M_p^2}\left(\frac{H}{2\pi}\right)^2\big|_{k=aH}
\end{equation}
where $M_p=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ is the reduced Planck mass and the Hubble parameter is evaluated at the time the mode $k$ is equal to the inverse comoving Hubble scale. In the scalar sector, the combination of metric and scalar field fluctuations that is conserved outside the horizon (in the gauge used in Eq.(\ref{eq:metric}) has power spectrum
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inf_Pzeta}
\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)=\frac{1}{2\epsilon M_p^2}\left(\frac{H}{2\pi}\right)^2\big|_{k=aH}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon=-\dot{H}/H^2$ is the first slow-roll parameter. 

Current constraints on the amplitude of primordial tensor modes already rule out some inflationary models.  We will discuss in detail what a detection of primordial gravitational waves would imply for inflation in the next several sections, but it is also important to note that a detection would rule out contracting universe scenarios. A contracting universe can also put large scales in causal contact if the scale factor $a$ is nearly constant while the Hubble parameter increases. This means the spectrum of gravitational wave fluctuations will be very blue \cite{Khoury:2001wf}. In addition the Hubble parameter at the end of the contracting phase can be approximately bounded (minimally, $H<M_p$, or $H\sim T_{\rm reheat}$) and so the value of $H$ that sets the amplitude of tensor fluctuations on scales accessible through the CMB must be exponentially smaller. The vacuum fluctuations in a contracting universe are then far too small to be detected \cite{Boyle:2003km}.

\subsection{A new scale of particle physics}
\label{sec:scale-of-inflation}
From the inflationary prediction for the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves, Eq.(\ref{eq:inf_Pt}), a detection means a direct measurement of the Hubble scale during inflation. Furthermore, it is the potential energy $V$ of the scalar field that sources the expansion according to $3M_p^2H^2=V$. Using the measured value of the scalar fluctuations from the {\it Planck} satellite, we can then derive the energy scale $V$ in terms of $r$ (all at the pivot scale $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$
\begin{equation}
V^{1/4}=1.04\times 10^{16}{\rm GeV}\left(\frac{r_*}{0.01}\right)^{1/4}
\end{equation}



\begin{itemize}
\item Models that also generate a significant amplitude of gravitational waves from particle sources are also constrained by signatures in the scalar fluctuations (especially non-Gaussianity). \cite{Mirbabayi:2014jqa, Ozsoy:2014sba} find that at most $\sim x\%$ or so (get the exact number) could be from sources other than the de Sitter quantum fluctuations. New proposed scenarios where all could be  \cite{Namba:2015gja}. How much room is there? Do improved constraints on NG, etc, remove this window? {\bf Expect text from Sorbo, Peloso.}
\item Should we address these papers at all: 1410.8845, rebutted in 1508.01527, re-rebutted in 1510.06759, (different author) 1510.07956?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Large $r$, inflaton field range, symmetries}
The spectrum of tensor fluctuations depends only on the Hubble ($H$) parameter during inflation, while the scalar power depends on both $H$ and the evolution of the homogeneous field sourcing inflation. This means that the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, can be related to the inflaton field range in Planck units \cite{Lyth:1996im}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Lyth}
\frac{\Delta\Phi}{M_p}=\int_0^{\mathcal{N}_{\rm end}}d\mathcal{N}\,\left(\frac{r}{8}\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}$ is the total number of e-folds needed to put the largest observed scales in causal contact during inflation.

Remarkably, the distance the inflaton moves in field space may be used to infer some properties of quantum gravity from the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. As bottom-up effective theories, Lagrangians describing inflation need only be valid up to some scale $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ where $H<\Lambda_{\rm UV}\lesssim M_P$. Scenarios with $\Delta\Phi\sim\mathcal{O}(\Lambda_{\rm UV})$ and $\Lambda_{\rm UV}\approx M_p$ (``large field inflation") can be constructed if the inflaton interactions are invariant under a shift symmetry, $\Phi\rightarrow\Phi+c$. The symmetry must be weakly broken to allow for slow-roll inflation but is nonetheless sufficient to ensure that quantum corrections from the inflaton and graviton will not introduce large corrections to the inflationary Lagrangian \cite{Linde:2005ht, Kaloper:2011jz, Csaki:2014bua,Kaplan:2015fuy,Choi:2015fiu}. However, it is non-trivial to arrive at large-field inflation from the top-down, beginning with a theory valid up to energies well above those needed for inflation. Generically, fields that are heavy enough to be integrated out in constructing the effective theory of inflation ( $m>\Lambda_{\rm UV}$) will introduce corrections to the potential that will limit the field range to $\Delta\Phi\ll\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ (``small-field inflation"). Beyond extrapolating our understanding of effective field theory from energies that are tested experimentally this difficulty is also well studied in string theory, which provides a scale $\Lambda_{\rm UV}=\Lambda_{\rm string}\lesssim M_p$. As the best developed candidate for the theory of quantum gravity, string theory is a useful framework for exploring mechanisms that may allow large-field inflation to be realized even in the presence of heavy degrees of freedom. Several promising constructions have been proposed \cite{Silverstein:2008sg, McAllister:2008hb, Berg:2009tg, Palti:2014kza,McAllister:2014mpa, Marchesano:2014mla, Blumenhagen:2015xpa}. However, there is also interesting current discussion of whether at least some apparent means to achieve large field inflation (via multiple axions) may be incompatible with basic principles of quantum gravity \cite{delaFuente:2014aca,Bachlechner:2015qja,Heidenreich:2015wga,Kooner:2015rza}. 

Equation (\ref{eq:Lyth}) can be used to determine a useful theoretical threshold for $r$ that would allow the most robust conclusion about the field range of the inflaton. Give the possibility that $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ may be slightly below $M_p$, and the desire for true parametric control of corrections rather than accidental cancellations, we will define small-field inflation as requiring $\frac{\Delta\Phi}{M_p}\ll1$ (in contrast to perhaps half the literature where the line is drawn at $\frac{\Delta\Phi}{M_p}=1$). The total number of e-folds needed to put the largest scales in causal contact depends on the reheating temperature, but since the integrand in Eq.(\ref{eq:Lyth}) is always positive, we can use constraints on the $\approx 7$ e-folds constrained by current CMB observations to provide a conservative bound. The evolution of $r$ during inflation is model dependent, but as a simple starting point consider canonical single-field slow-roll inflation where the consistency relation between $r$ and $n_T$ to write $d\ln r/d\mathcal{N}=-(n_s-1)-\frac{r}{8}$. The variation of this quantity is second-order in slow-roll parameters, so as a first pass we may take it to be constant and use the {\it Planck} satellite constraints assuming constant $n_s$ (and allowing a $3\sigma$ interval) to find
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\Phi}{M_p}\ll1\Rightarrow r\lesssim0.002.
\end{equation}
Allowing the spectral index to run, we may use the second-order consistency relation $d\ln r/d\mathcal{N}=-\frac{r}{8}(n_s-1+\frac{r}{8})$ and {\it Planck} constraints to find 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\Phi}{M_p}\ll1\Rightarrow r\lesssim0.0015.
\end{equation}
One might try to construct scenarios where the evolution of the tensor-to-scalar ratio violates slow-roll sufficiently to allow inflation scenarios with $\frac{\Delta\Phi}{M_p}\ll1$ to generate $r\sim\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ or higher \cite{BenDayan:2009kvHotchkiss:2011gzm, Chatterjee:2014hna}. These attempts are under considerable pressure from {\it Planck observations}....{\bf I'd like to add, if it's true, a demonstration of the stronger statement that it's not possible?}

In summary, a conclusive detection with a CMB S4 instrument would provide strong evidence that the theory of quantum gravity must accommodate a shift symmetry for the inflaton. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:scale-of-inflation}, there may be some room for small-field inflation to generate a signal from non-vacuum fluctuations. Whether or not future constraints on non-Gaussianity completely close that window, the {\it absence} of a detection with CMB S4 will robustly rule out large-field inflation. 

{\it A detection of $r$, together with high confidence that the gravitational waves are sourced from vacuum fluctuations alone, would provide the only data point for the foreseeable future that weighs in on quantum gravity.}

\subsection{Other probes allowed by a detection}
The cosmic microwave background is not the only probe of primordial gravitational waves, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is not the only parameter that describes the vacuum fluctuations. Additional details, including the scalar tilt and higher order correlations probe possible extensions beyond Einstein gravity and minimal coupling of the inflationary matter fields to gravity. Especially if the amplitude of gravitational waves is large enough to be measured in the CMB, it is worth considering whether there are additional features we might then hope to measure and what would be needed to do so. Although we do not find that these considerations affect the optimal design of CMB S4 ({\bf right?}), they are interesting in considering complementarity with other possible future instruments.

The simplest inflation scenarios all predict a red spectrum for gravitational waves. However, some extensions can produce a blue tilt \cite{}. A detection on CMB scales would allow precise predictions in those cases for the amplitude expected on scales accessible to direct detection by, eg Advanced LIGO and future generations.  A recent analysis in \cite{Lasky:2015lej} shows the complementarity between observations over a wide range of scales in constraining the spectrum (although one must assume a constant tilt $n_T$ over many orders of magnitude).

{\bf If LIGO has really made a detection, will that affect any statements here? eg, about size of astrophysical signals that must be understood to extract stochastic background?}

The three-point function of gravitational waves would also be a sensitive probe of possible extensions of Einstein gravity \cite{}. In standard inflation, the three point correlations between tensors alone and tensors and scalars scale as $\langle\zeta\zeta\gamma\rangle\propto P_{\zeta}P_{\gamma}$, $\langle\zeta\gamma\gamma\rangle\sim\langle\gamma\gamma\gamma\rangle\propto P_{\gamma}P_{\gamma}$. In other words, $f^{\rm tensor}_{\rm NL}\sim 1$ \cite{}. Although direct detection experiments benefit from long integration times, one study suggested that even BBO would not be able to detect the standard three-point \cite{Adshead:2009bz} for $r<xxx$. Need a boost of at least xxx... Even with extensions it is difficult to see how such a signal could be obtained?

\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar power spectrum: running, wiggles
\item non-Gaussianity (three point function, four point function)
{\bf text from Joel Meyers, so far just copied from wiki except tex-ified} \\
The present best constraints on local non-Gaussianity come from the Planck 2015 analysis and give $f_{\rm NL} = 0.8 \pm 5.0$ (68\% CL) [Planck2015 - 1502.01592]. A noise-free cosmic variance limited CMB experiment is expected to produce constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ with 1$\sigma$ error bars of about 3 [astro-ph/0005036]. Therefore the best that can be expected of CMB Stage-IV is slightly less than a factor of two improvement on the current best limits.

A detection of local non-Gaussianity would have far reaching theoretical implications, since any significant detection of local $f_{\rm NL}$ would rule out all models of single clock inflation [astro-ph/0407059]. In the absence of a detection, however, it is important to ask what can be learned from improved constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$. Though not firm, nor entirely robustly defined, it can be argued that a natural theoretical threshold where qualitatively new general conclusions about the physics of the early universe can be drawn would come from constraints on $f_{\rm NL}<\mathcal{O}(1)$, see for example [1412.4671] for a fuller discussion. In order to achieve this level of constraint, it seems necessary to move beyond the cosmic microwave background to study other data sets, such as large scale structure. Despite the fact that CMB Stage-IV is not expected to reach this threshold, it is worth asking what can be gleaned from an improved constraint on $f_{\rm NL}$ from the CMB.

There do exist some well motivated models for the origin of fluctuations in the early universe which predict local non-Gaussianity at a level where CMB Stage-IV could either hint toward, or slightly disfavor at around the level of 2$\sigma$. These models include the simplest modulated reheating scenario [astro-ph/0306006] and ekpyrotic cosmology [0906.0530], both of which predict $f_{\rm NL}\sim5$.

In the modulated reheating scenario, the field which drives inflation $\Phi$ decays to the particles of the standard model with a rate $\gamma$ which is determined by the value of a second field $\sigma$ which remains light throughout inflation. The quantum fluctuations in $\sigma$ result in a spatially modulated reheating surface resulting in the curvature perturbations that we observe in the CMB and large scale structure. The process by which the fluctuations in the light field are converted into curvature fluctuations naturally results in local non-Gaussianity given by $f_{\rm NL} = 5(1-\Gamma \Gamma^{\prime\prime}/\Gamma^{\prime2})$, where this formula holds in the case that $\Phi$ oscillates about a quadratic minimum after inflation and the fluctuations in $\Phi$ make a negligible contribution to the observed power spectrum.

This can be contrasted with the simplest curvaton scenario, where a field ? which remains light during inflation comes to dominate the energy density of the universe after the field which drives inflation $\Phi$ decays. The fluctuations in the energy density of ? then determine the curvature perturbations that are observed today. The local non-Gaussianity in this simple model is predicted to be $f_{\rm NL} = -5/4$ [hep-ph/0110002], which is unfortunately a few times smaller than the expected error bar from CMB Stage-IV.

Absent a significant detection of local non-Gaussianity (which is unlikely given the current constraints from Planck), CMB Stage-IV can provide useful constraints or tantalizing hints about particular models of the early universe, though it will unfortunately be unable to reach the level of constraint at which broader conclusions can be drawn.
