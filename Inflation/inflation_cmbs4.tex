Inflation, a period of accelerated expansion of the Universe, is the leading paradigm for explaining the origin of the primordial density perturbations that grew into the CMB anisotropies and eventually into the stars and galaxies we see around us. In addition to primordial density perturbations, the rapid expansion creates primordial gravitational waves that imprint a characteristic polarization pattern onto the CMB. If our Universe is described by a typical model of inflation that naturally explains the statistical properties of the density perturbations, CMB-S4 will detect this signature of inflation. A detection of this particular polarization pattern would open a completely new window onto the physics of the early Universe and provide us with an additional relic left over from the hot big bang. This relic would constitute our most direct probe of the very early Universe and transform our understanding of several aspects of fundamental physics. Because the polarization pattern is due to quantum fluctuations in the gravitational field during inflation, it would provide insights into the quantum nature of gravity. The strength of the signal, encoded in the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, would provide a direct measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe during inflation. A detection with CMB-S4 would point to inflationary physics near the energy scale associated with grand unified theories and would provide additional evidence in favor of the idea of the unification of forces. Knowledge of the scale of inflation would also have broad implications for many other aspects of fundamental physics, including ubiquitous ingredients of string theory like axions and moduli.

Even an upper limit of $r<0.002$ at $95\%$ CL achievable by CMB-S4, over an order of magnitude stronger than current limits, would significantly advance our understanding of inflation. It would rule out the most popular and most widely studied classes of models and dramatically impact how we think about the theory. To some, the remaining class of models would be contrived enough to give up on inflation altogether. Furthermore, CMB-S4 is in a unique position to probe the statistical properties of density perturbations over the entire range of scales that can be probed through measurements of primary anisotropies in the temperature and polarization of the CMB and with unprecedented precision, providing us with invaluable information about the early Universe.

\section{Introduction}
%The study of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background will bring additional information about both the gravitational and matter sectors of the primordial universe. However, for primordial gravitational waves there are clear theoretical thresholds that can be reached with this next generation instrument. We will use the tensor-to-scalar ratio as the primary inflationary science driver for the design.

%The theory of cosmic inflation is the current leading model for the Universe's
%very early history.  But despite its success in matching what we know about the
%large-scale Universe, the paradigm
%lacks direct empirical tests.  CMB-S4 promises to change this.

%Inflation is the proposal that the Universe underwent a period of rapid,
%accelerating expansion in the first fraction of a second of its existence,
%due to the dominance of a hypothetical field called the inflaton
%(see e.g.\ Ref.~\cite{EllisWands}).

Proposed at first to solve certain conceptual puzzles of the hot big bang
model, inflation was soon recognized to be a highly compelling mechanism for
the generation of primordial perturbations
(e.g.\ \cite{Abbott:1986kb,Linde:2005ht,Lemoine:2008zz,EllisWands}).
The simplest models of inflation predict that our Hubble patch should have
almost zero mean curvature, and highly Gaussian, adiabatic primordial density perturbations with a nearly (but not quite)
scale-invariant power spectrum.
These generic features correspond closely with cosmological observations --
to date, we have fairly tight upper limits on mean curvature, primordial
non-Gaussianity, and the amplitudes of any non-adiabatic (isocurvature)
contributions to the perturbations. We also have a detection of a small
departure from scale invariance, consistent with the expectations of simple
inflationary models.

%The theory of cosmic inflation, in which the universe is proposed to have undergone a period of rapid, accelerating expansion in the first fraction of a second of its existence, is the current leading model for the universe's very early history. Proposed at first to solve certain conceptual puzzles of the hot big bang, inflation was soon recognized as a highly compelling mechanism for the generation of primordial perturbations as well. The inflationary paradigm has met with enormous empirical success. The simplest models of inflation predict that our Hubble patch should have nearly zero mean curvature and an adiabatic and nearly (but not quite) scale-invariant spectrum of highly Gaussian primordial scalar perturbations. To date, we have fairly tight upper limits on mean curvature, primordial non-Gaussianity, and the amplitudes of any non-adiabatic (isocurvature) contributions to the perturbations. We also have a detection of a small departure from scale invariance, consistent with the expectations of simple models. 

These successes, and the difficulties in the construction of alternative
scenarios that are also consistent with the data, have led most cosmologists to
see inflation as our best bet for the creation of the primordial perturbations,
while acknowledging that many questions remain. If inflation did occur, how did
it occur? Was there a single effective field dominating the dynamics of both
the background expansion and the perturbations, or were multiple fields
involved? How did it begin? Are ground-state fluctuations truly the source of density
perturbations? What is the connection of inflation to the rest of physics?
Are there observations that could falsify inflation?

%CMB-S4 will provide answers to some of these questions by opening a new window on the study of inflation, and on the generation of perturbations in general. Thus far, observed anisotropies can all be interpreted as resulting from scalar perturbations to the spacetime metric tensor.  With CMB-S4 we have an opportunity to investigate a new regime for the mechanism of the creation of these primordial perturbations: the {\em tensor} sector. The sensitivity of CMB measurements to tensor perturbations arises from the now well-known phenomenon of the generation of polarization in the CMB: scalar perturbations produce only curl-free E-mode polarization to first order, while tensor perturbations produce divergence-free B-mode polarization as well. Thus a measurement of B-mode polarization in the CMB (with the standard caveats relating to foregrounds and gravitational lensing) is a direct measurement of the amplitude of tensor perturbations.

Thus far, observed anisotropies can all be interpreted as resulting from density perturbations.  With CMB-S4 we have an opportunity to investigate a spectacular prediction of the inflationary paradigm: primordial gravitational waves. The sensitivity of CMB measurements to tensor perturbations arises from the generation of polarization in the CMB: scalar perturbations produce only curl-free E-mode polarization to first order, while tensor perturbations produce divergence-free B-mode polarization as well. Thus a measurement of B-mode polarization in the CMB (with the standard caveats relating to foregrounds and gravitational lensing) is a direct measurement of the amplitude of tensor perturbations.

Of course we do not know that inflation is correct -- and the value of this new window is much more general than the inflationary paradigm itself.  Nevertheless, we can use the inflationary picture as a concrete framework for exploring the potential impact of these measurements. The tensor sector offers a more direct probe of the dynamics of the inflationary expansion because tensor perturbations are an inevitable consequence of the degrees of freedom of the spacetime metric obeying the uncertainty principle. In other words, the existence of an inflationary epoch in the Universe's past directly implies the existence of a background of tensor perturbations. Furthermore, the amplitude of the tensor perturbations depends only on the rate of expansion during inflation. In contrast, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations depends on both the amplitude and slope of the effective potential of the field responsible for inflation, and more generally on the sound speed of the inflaton field as well.

In addition to probing the origin of all structure in the Universe, opening the tensor sector enables us to probe physics at length scales $\sim 10^9$ times smaller than those probed at the LHC. The small length scales (corresponding to the high energies of inflation) are stretched to the size of the future horizon during inflation, becoming accessible because of the immense amount of expansion during and since the inflationary epoch, magnifying these tiny lengths to ones of astrophysical size. If the tensor perturbations are detectable, we are already probing physics at these length scales via the scalar perturbations, but we cannot know this until the tensor perturbations are actually detected.

We currently only have upper limits on the amplitude of tensor perturbations -- limits that are only marginally stronger than those that can be inferred from measuring temperature anisotropies \cite{Ade:2015lrj,Array:2015xqh}. To detect tensor perturbations we need to dramatically improve measurements of CMB polarization. %On degree scales a polarization pattern known as B-mode polarization would reveal the existence of primordial gravitational waves. 
In the tensor sector, CMB-S4 will improve current constraints by over an order of magnitude. This is especially interesting because it allows this next-generation instrument to reach theoretically well-motivated thresholds for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ (the ratio of power in tensor modes to power in scalar modes), which consequently serves as the primary inflationary science driver for the design. 

It is worth pointing out explicitly that these tensor perturbations are by definition gravitational waves. With the recent LIGO detections \cite{Abbott:2016blz,Abbott:2016nmj}, we have entered the era of gravitational wave astronomy, and with CMB-S4 we will be targeting the ultra long-wavelength end of nature's gravitational wave spectrum. We expect the background of inflation-produced gravitational waves to be nearly scale-invariant, and that waves with frequencies $\sim 10^{15}$ times higher than those detectable with CMB-S4 may one day be detectable with a space-based observatory \cite{Caligiuri:2014sla}, greatly enhancing the value of any CMB-S4 detection. 

Inflation predicts B-mode fluctuations sourced by primordial gravitational waves. But more generally, the B-mode signal carries information about both the spectrum of primordial perturbations in the tensor (and vector) components of the metric and any physics that affected the evolution of those modes once they re-entered the horizon. Furthermore, the inflationary sector is not isolated from the rest of particle physics at high energies. In the context of specific proposals for physics beyond the standard model, including dark matter models, a detection of B-modes can have consequences for predictions for the post-inflation spectrum of particles and their thermodynamics. These models may also provide observables other than the amplitude of B-modes that constrain inflationary physics. The rich interplay of inflation models and other physics beyond the standard model is discussed in detail later in this chapter and in Chapters 4 and 5.
%in Section 5.%need to figure out how to reference chapters 

%In the simplest models of inflation, a detection of $r$ also has significant implications for models dark matter, in particular the well-motivated QCD axion. It should also be noted that $r$ is not the only way to measure $V$, and isocurvature, combined with DM direct detection, provides a possible alternative if $V$ is far below the GUT scale. These points are discussed in Section~\ref{axion_iso}.

{\it A detection of primordial gravitational waves would open a completely new window on the physical processes of the early Universe and reveal a new length scale of particle physics, far below those accessible with terrestrial particle colliders. }

If the overall amplitude of the B-mode signal is large enough to be detected at high significance by the CMB-S4 instrument, we will be able characterize the statistics of the tensor perturbations. Investigating the scale-dependence of the amplitude of tensor fluctuations and their Gaussianity will allow us to determine if the signal is consistent with the amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the metric during inflation. If CMB-S4 measurements are consistent with a nearly scale-invariant and a weakly non-Gaussian spectrum, a detection would:
\begin{itemize}
 \item identify the energy scale of inflation;
 \item provide strong evidence that gravity is quantized, at least at the linear level;
 \item provide strong evidence that the complete theory of quantum gravity must accommodate a Planckian field range for the inflaton.
\end{itemize}

Departures from a nearly scale-invariant, Gaussian spectrum would reveal new physics beyond the simplest inflationary models. There are currently a few models with significantly different signatures generated by a richer inflationary or post-inflationary sector, and these predictions would be tested. However, given the lack of observational constraints on physics at such high energy scales there is also enormous discovery potential. Polarization data will provide new consistency checks on the current dominant theoretical framework, including model-independent constraints on the graviton mass and constraints on alternatives to inflation.

%Even in the absence of a detection CMB-S4 would provide invaluable information about the physics of the early universe. An upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r<0.002$ at $95\%$ CL would rule out large classes of models of inflation. In particular, such an upper limit would rule out or strongly disfavor all models that naturally explain the observed value of the scalar spectral index and in which the characteristic scale in field space equals or exceeds the Planck scale. This includes currently popular monomial models as well as Starobinsky and Higgs inflation models. This would dramatically change how we think about the theory, and perhaps force us to rethink the paradigm altogether. Furthermore, CMB-S4 would likely measure the primary CMB anisotropies in temperature and E-mode polarization over the entire range of scales that is not contaminated by unresolved foregrounds and will extend the range of scales we have access to by another $e$-fold. This will either provide additional support for small-field models of inflation or rule out the basic paradigm.

Even in the absence of a detection CMB-S4 would provide invaluable information about the physics of the early universe. Many of the most appealing inflation models have simple monomial potentials. Current observations already put considerable pressure on those (e.g. the $m^2\phi^2$ potential), but do not probe the entire interesting parameter space. CMB-S4 should be designed to comprehensively rule out or detect the remaining monomial models. However, to be more than an incremental improvement it should also push for the first time into a completely new regime, reaching well into the only other remaining viable class of models that can naturally explain the observed value of the spectral index. Purely in terms of dynamics or scale, there is not a sharp threshold on what may ultimately be possible or interesting within this class. For example, models with a field range or characteristic mass scale of $\sim0.1 M_p$ extend down to a tensor-to-scalar ratio of below $r\sim10^{-4}$. However, Lagrangians of special interest in this class (eg, Starobinsky and Higgs inflation) predict a significantly larger amplitude of primordial gravitational waves, $r\sim0.003$. Thus, an upper limit of $r<0.002$ at $95\%$ CL would rule them out. The remaining allowed space would be restricted enough to dramatically change how we think about inflation, and perhaps force us to rethink the paradigm altogether. Certainly some would consider all natural models to be ruled out. This is where we believe CMB-S4 should aim. Section~\ref{sec:upperLimits} discusses the details of this argument, and the spectral index and $r$ values for various models are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:nsrp01}.

%{\bf Insert paragraph emphasizing inflation-related gains from the scalar sector with CMB-S4.} 
%Beyond these significant gains from B-modes, CMB-S4 will likely measure the primary CMB anisotropies in temperature and E-mode polarization over the entire range of scales that is not contaminated by unresolved foregrounds and will extend the range of scales we have access to by another $e$-fold. This will allow improvements of order a factor of two on a wide variety of other inflationary and post-inflationary physics. 

In the next section, Section~\ref{sec:basics}, we provide a basic introduction to the inflationary paradigm in its simplest form. Section~\ref{sec:needs} discusses the forecasted sensitivity of CMB-S4 designed to reach the theoretically motivated goal of  tensor-to-scalar ratio $r<0.002$ at $95\%$ CL and some of the experimental, observational, and analysis challenges involved in achieving this sensitivity. In Section~\ref{sec:detection} we review in detail what a detection of primordial gravitational waves would mean and what follow-up measurements could be done to further characterize any signal. Section~\ref{sec:upperLimits} explains in detail the implications of a robust upper limit of $r<0.002$ at $95\%$ CL. Sections \ref{sec:scalar} through \ref{sec:PMF} describe the significant gains CMB-S4 will allow in constraining other aspects of the primordial Universe, both standard and more speculative. These include characterizing the scalar power spectrum, constraining curvature, scalar non-Gaussianity, isocurvature modes, further probes of CMB ``anomalies'', and constraints on cosmic strings. We summarize in Section~\ref{sec:summary}.
 

\section{Basics of cosmological inflation}
\label{sec:basics}

In this section, we introduce the essential concepts of cosmological inflation. We do this in two stages, first giving a broad outline of the important concepts then proceeding to a more technical definition.  Rather than surveying the extensive historical literature, we refer the reader to several review articles and books for further information
\cite{LythRiotto,LiddleLyth,Mukhanov:2005sc,Baumann:2009ds,Linde:2005dd,EllisWands}.

\subsection{Inflation basics I: A heuristic picture}

Inflation is, by definition, a period of accelerating expansion. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:PTfigs}, an accelerating universe has a causal structure very different from that of a decelerating universe. In a decelerating universe, a pair of separated comoving particles evolves from being causally disconnected -- in which case the particles, unable to influence each other, are said to be ``superhorizon'' -- to being causally connected, or ``subhorizon.'' In an accelerating universe, the opposite occurs. In the inflationary scenario, the Universe undergoes an accelerating stage, which is followed by a long period of deceleration.


\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.3098\textwidth]{Inflation/CausalStructureAcceleration.png}}
\includegraphics[width=0.349\textwidth]{Inflation/QuantumFluctuationsCropped.png}
\end{center}
\caption{{\bf Left and center panels}: In an expanding universe, the distance between two separated points increases over time, simply due to the expansion of the space between them. The two panels here show the spacetime trajectories of two comoving points, A and B. For the decelerating expansion illustrated in the left panel, the separation rate is greater in the past and even exceeds the speed of light at sufficiently early times. Thus A and B go from being out of causal contact -- unable to influence each other -- to being in causal contact. In an accelerating universe, the separation rate is smaller in the past; the two points go from being in causal contact to being out of causal contact. In the inflationary universe scenario, an early epoch of acceleration -- the inflationary era -- smoothly maps onto a long period of deceleration. Thus two points can go from being in causal contact to out of causal contact and, much later, back into causal contact. \newline
\mbox{\bf Right panel}: Fluctuations in the value of the inflaton field, which is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the cosmos, evolve differently, depending on whether their wavelength $\lambda$ is less than or greater than the horizon length $L = c/H$. When $\lambda \ll L$, the uncertainty principle limits how smooth the field can be. As a result, the amplitude of the fluctuation is inversely proportional to $\lambda$ and thus decreases as the Universe expands (and the influence of the uncertainty principle is reflected by the appearance of Planck's constant $\hbar$ in the expression for the amplitude). As $\lambda$ becomes larger than the horizon, the crests and troughs of the wave cease to be in causal contact, so the amplitude stops evolving. For superhorizon evolution, the asymptotic value of the amplitude corresponds to replacing the wavelength in the subhorizon case with $2\pi L$. Eventually, cosmic expansion stretches the fluctuations to astrophysically large length scales. Elsewhere in this document $\hbar$ and $c$ are set equal to unity.

\label{fig:PTfigs}
\end{figure}


In view of the early period of accelerating expansion, two separated regions in the Universe that are now causally disconnected could have been able to interact with each other during the inflationary epoch (which of course was one of the original motivations for inflation). Causally connected perturbations in those two regions -- for example, an underdensity in one and an overdensity in the other -- could thus have been created at very early times. Quantum mechanics provides a mechanism for generating such perturbations, and in fact makes them unavoidable. Quantum mechanical fluctuations initially created with sub-nuclear wavelengths are stretched by the cosmic expansion to millimeter length scales within a tiny fraction of a second; at present they are astrophysically large. Thus observations of cosmic structure give us an opportunity to probe physics on extremely small length scales.

Accelerating expansion requires the Universe to have an energy density that dilutes relatively slowly with expansion. In inflationary models, such an energy density is usually obtained via the introduction of a new field $\phi$, called the inflaton field with Lagrangian density, in the simplest cases, given by
\begin{equation}
{\cal L} = - \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi - V(\phi)
\end{equation}
where $V(\phi)$ is a potential energy density. 

A generic inflaton field configuration will not lead to inflation. But if there is a large enough patch of space in which $\phi$ takes values for which the potential is sufficiently flat, $\phi$ will rapidly evolve to satisfy the ``slow-roll condition,'' namely $\frac{1}{2} \left(d\phi/dt\right)^2 \ll V(\phi)$. When both the spatial and temporal derivatives of the inflaton field are small, $V(\phi)$ is nearly constant in time and makes the dominant contribution to the energy density, $\rho$. Under such conditions, and given the Friedmann equation $\dot a/a \propto \sqrt{\rho}$, the patch inflates. In the limit that the energy density is completely constant in time, the scale factor grows as $e^{H t}$, and points separated by more than $c/H$ are causally disconnected.

A standard assumption in the calculation of inflationary perturbation spectra is that the field is as smooth as it possibly can be, and still be consistent with the uncertainty principle. As Fig.~\ref{fig:PTfigs} shows, these fluctuations will be stretched to astrophysically large length scales by cosmic expansion. In an inflationary scenario quantum fluctuations provide the initial seeds of all structure in the Universe. 

As $\phi$ rolls toward the potential minimum, $V(\phi)$ eventually becomes smaller than $\frac{1}{2}(d\phi/dt)^2$; the slow-roll condition is no longer met, and inflation ends. Decays of the inflaton to other particles -- irrelevant during inflation because the decay products were quickly diluted by expansion -- then become important. The remaining energy in the $\phi$ field converts to a thermal bath of the particles of the standard model, and perhaps other particles as well -- beginning what is usually called the ``hot big bang'' model.

The small but nonzero spatial fluctuations in $\phi$ cause inflation to end at different times in different locations. In a sense, we can see these spatial variations in the end of the inflationary epoch when we observe anisotropies in the CMB.  In those regions where inflation ends relatively early, the mass density is lower due to the extra expansion that the region has undergone since the end of inflation. Thus the slightly different expansion histories of different locations result in density differences; those small density perturbations eventually grow under the influence of gravity to create all the structures we observe in the Universe today.

The spacetime metric itself presumably also obeys the uncertainty principle. As a result, we expect gravitational waves to be produced during inflation as well. Just as with fluctuations of the inflaton field, they have their amplitude set to a value proportional to the Hubble parameter $H$ during inflation. Detecting the influence of that gravitational-wave background on the CMB would allow cosmologists to infer $H$ and hence the energy scale of the inflationary potential. Observations of density perturbations, by contrast, provide a relatively indirect look at the inflationary era. As emphasized already, CMB-S4 is poised to detect, or place interesting upper limits, on the amplitude and spectrum of inflation-produced gravitational waves via their signature in B-mode polarization. 


\subsection{Inflation basics II: Quantifying the predictions}

The overall evolution of the Universe is well modeled by a Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker line element
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-dt^2+a^2(t)\left[\frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2}+r^2d\Omega^2\right]\,,
\end{equation}
where $k=0$ for a flat spatial geometry, $k=\pm1$ allows for spatial curvature, and the time evolution is specified by the scale factor, $a(t)$. The Hubble parameter, $H=\dot{a}/a$, gives the rate of expansion of the Universe. A period of inflation will drive the spatial curvature close to zero, in good agreement with current observations. We will assume spatial flatness and set $k=0$ for most considerations, but see Section~\ref{sec:curvature} for a discussion of CMB-S4 constraints on curvature. 

Since the period of cosmic inflation has to end, there must exist a clock, or scalar degree of freedom. According to the uncertainty principle this clock must fluctuate, generating density perturbations that are adiabatic. In the most economic scenarios, these density perturbations are the seeds that grow into the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the stars and galaxies around us. Other degrees of freedom could, of course, also be present during this phase and might even be responsible for the generation of the density perturbations we observe. In this section, for simplicity, we restrict the analysis to the case of fluctuations of the clock field only, propagating with sound speed $c_s=1$.

%{\bf (Mention isocurvature modes here?)}

%{\bf LK: I think this paragraph should probably get moved elsewhere -- perhaps to a discussion of inflation falsifiability that we need to include somewhere.}
%This is really repeated later, and I think we lose nothing by commenting this out.
%We mention an alternative to inflation here.  Observations of the cosmic microwave background provide strong evidence for a period preceding the hot big bang, during which the co-moving Hubble radius, $(a|H|)^{-1}$, was decreasing with time: the measured average CMB temperature and the statistics of the measured anisotropies are the same over regions that otherwise share no causal history. Inflation is one way of arranging for a period of decreasing co-moving Hubble radius, as an expanding and accelerating universe will have such a Hubble radius. Alternatively, the phase of decreasing co-moving Hubble radius could have occurred during a period of decelerating contraction, which must then be followed by a bounce, as in the ``ekpyrotic'' or ``matter bounce'' scenarios \cite{Khoury:2001wf,Khoury:2001bz,Steinhardt:2001st,Nayeri:2005ck,Brandenberger:2012zb,Cai:2014jla,deHaro:2015wda}. 
% The matter field that sources this expansion should have an equation of state $w\simeq -1$, which is minimally provided by a single scalar field whose energy density is predominately determined by its potential.

%The remarkable feature of inflation is that once an evolving scalar field is invoked to source the background accelerated expansion, quantum fluctuations during inflation inevitably generate post-inflationary metric perturbations. 
For these early times, the ADM formalism \cite{Arnowitt:1962hi}
provides a convenient parametrization of the line element in the presence of perturbations
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:metric}
ds^2&=&-N^2dt^2 +h_{ij}(dx^i+N^idt)(dx^j+N^jdt)\,\nonumber\\
h_{ij}&=&a^2(t)[e^{2\zeta}\delta_{ij}+\gamma_{ij}]\,.
\end{eqnarray}

The equations of motion for $N$ (the lapse) and $N^i$ (the shift) are the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, while $\zeta$ 
%(equivalent to $-\mathcal{R}$ in the Planck Collaboration papers) 
and $\gamma_{ij}$ contain the dynamical scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. In scenarios with matter sources other than a scalar field there may also be vector perturbations. These rapidly decay and can be neglected unless they are actively sourced in the post-inflationary Universe, e.g. by cosmic strings.

Because the equations of motion are invariant under translations, and the perturbations small enough to work in perturbation theory, it is convenient to work with the Fourier transforms
\begin{equation}
\zeta(t,\mathbf{x})=\int \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3}\zeta(t,\mathbf{k})e^{i \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}+{\rm h.c.}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad\gamma_{ij}(t,\mathbf{x})=\sum\limits_\sigma\int\frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3}\gamma_\sigma(t,\mathbf{k})e_{ij}(\mathbf{k},\sigma)e^{i \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}+{\rm h.c.}\,,
\end{equation}
where $e_{ij}(\mathbf{k},\sigma)$ is the transverse-traceless polarization tensor for the graviton, $\sigma$ labels the polarization states of the gravitational waves,
and `h.c.' stands for the Hermitian conjugate. The solutions oscillate when the modes are deep inside the horizon, $k\gg aH$. By definition, the modes exit the horizon when $k=aH$ and in single-field models approach a constant outside the horizon when $k\ll aH$.

The statistical properties of the scalar and tensor fluctuations, $\zeta$ and $\gamma_\sigma$, at times sufficiently late so that they have frozen out, provide the link between the primordial era and the observed CMB today as well as other probes of the structure of the late Universe. For a universe that is statistically homogeneous and isotropic and in which the primordial fluctuations are Gaussian, the information about the statistical properties is contained in the 2-point correlation functions
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle\zeta(\mathbf{k})\zeta(\mathbf{k}^{\prime})\rangle&=&(2\pi)^3\delta^3(\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{k}^{\prime})\frac{2\pi^2}{k^3}\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k),\nonumber\\
\langle\gamma_\sigma(\mathbf{k})\gamma_{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{k}^{\prime})\rangle&=&(2\pi)^3\delta_{\sigma\sigma^{\prime}}\delta^3(\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{k}^{\prime})\frac{2\pi^2}{k^3}\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{P}_{t}(k),\nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
where the factor of $1/2$ in the second to last line accounts for the fact that the measured power includes contributions from each of the two graviton polarizations. In single-field slow-roll inflation, the gauge-invariant combination of metric and scalar field fluctuations that is conserved outside the horizon has the power spectrum
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inf_Pzeta}
\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)=\frac{1}{2\epsilon M_{\rm P}^2}\left.\left(\frac{H}{2\pi}\right)^2\right|_{k=aH},
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon=-\dot{H}/H^2$ is the first slow-roll parameter, and $M_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ is the reduced Planck mass. As indicated, the Hubble parameter and $\epsilon$ are to be evaluated at horizon exit, when the wavenumber $k$ is equal to the inverse comoving Hubble radius. In the absence of additional sources, the tensor power spectrum generated by inflation is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inf_Pt}
\mathcal{P}_{t}(k)=\frac{8}{M_{\rm P}^2}\left.\left(\frac{H}{2\pi}\right)^2\right|_{k=aH}.
\end{equation}

It is convenient to introduce the logarithmic derivatives of these power spectra 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:specind}
n_{\rm s}(k)-1\equiv\frac{d\ln \mathcal{P}_{\zeta}}{d\ln k}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad n_{\rm t}(k)\equiv \frac{d\ln \mathcal{P}_{\rm t}}{d\ln k}\,.
\end{equation}
If the Hubble rate and slow-roll parameter only weakly depend on time as in slow-roll inflation, these will be $n_{\rm s}(k)\simeq 1$ and $n_{\rm t}(k)\simeq 0$, nearly independent of scale, and can be expanded around a pivot scale $k_\ast$ accessible by the CMB
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm s}(k)-1=n_{\rm s}-1+\left.\frac{dn_{\rm s}(k)}{d\ln k}\right|_{k_\ast}\ln(k/k_\ast)+\dots \qquad{\rm and}\qquad n_{\rm t}(k)=n_{\rm t}+\left.\frac{dn_{\rm t}(k)}{d\ln k}\right|_{k_\ast}\ln(k/k_\ast)+\dots \,.
\end{equation}
In this approximation, the power spectra are
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:power_spectra_power_law}
\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)&=& A_{\rm s}\left(\frac{k}{k_\ast}\right)^{n_{\rm s}-1+\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{dn_{\rm s}}{d\ln k}\right|_{k=k_\ast}\ln(k/k_\ast)+\dots}\,,\nonumber\\
\mathcal{P}_{t}(k)&=& A_{\rm t} \left(\frac{k}{k_\ast}\right)^{n_{\rm t}+\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{dn_{\rm t}}{d\ln k}\right|_{k=k_\ast}\ln(k/k_\ast)+\dots}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:specind}
%\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)\equiv A_{\rm s}\left(\frac{k}{k_\ast}\right)^{n_{\rm s}-1}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad\mathcal{P}_{t}(k)\equiv A_{\rm t} \left(\frac{k}{k_\ast}\right)^{n_{\rm t}}\,,
%\end{equation}
where $A_{\rm s}$, $A_{\rm t}$ are the scalar and tensor amplitudes, and $n_{\rm s}$ and $n_{\rm t}$, are the scalar and tensor spectral indices, respectively, both at the pivot scale. 
The tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, is the relative power in the two types of fluctuations at a chosen pivot scale $k_\ast$ (e.g. values of 0.002 and
0.05\,Mpc$^{-1}$ have been used in previous studies)
\begin{equation}
r=\frac{A_{\rm t}}{A_{\rm s}}\;.
\end{equation}

The power spectra of $\zeta$ and $\gamma_\sigma$ are time-independent as long as the modes are outside the horizon, and only begin to evolve once the modes of interest re-enter the horizon at late times. In particular, they set the initial conditions for the system of equations governing the time evolution of the Universe from a temperature of around $10^9$ K (when electrons and positrons have just annihilated) to the present. To exhibit the link between the primordial perturbations and late time observables explicitly, note that in a spatially flat universe, the contributions of primordial scalar perturbations to the angular power spectra of temperature or E-mode anisotropies are given by
\begin{equation}
C^{({\rm s,t})}_{XX,\ell}=\int \frac{dk}{k}\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)\left|\int\limits_0^{\tau_0} d\tau S_X^{({\rm s,t})}(k,\tau)j_\ell(k(\tau_0-\tau))\right|^2\,,
\label{eq:clscalar}
\end{equation}
where $j_\ell$ is a spherical Bessel function that encodes the (spatially flat) geometry of the Universe and $S_X^{({\rm s,t})}(k,\tau)$ with $X=T,E$ are source functions for scalar and tensor modes that encode the evolution of the modes in the hot big bang Universe.
% (in particular, the physics of recombination is very important for B-modes). - removed this because 2.12 is only about T/E
% and $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ is the power spectrum of initial conditions of primordial scalar perturbations as a function of the (comoving) momentum of the modes. 
At linear order, scalar perturbations only contribute to the angular power spectra of temperature and E-mode polarization and the cross-spectrum of temperature and E-mode polarization, while the tensor perturbations in addition generate B-mode polarization. The primordial contribution of the tensor perturbations to the angular power spectrum of B-modes is 
\begin{equation}
C^{({\rm t})}_{BB,\ell}=\int \frac{dk}{k}\mathcal{P}_{\rm t}(k)\left|\int\limits_0^{\tau_0} d\tau S_B^{({\rm t})}(k,\tau)j_\ell(k(\tau_0-\tau))\right|^2\,.
\label{eq:clbb}
\end{equation}
where $S_B^{({\rm t})}(k,\tau)$ is the appropriate source function. 

The results of calculations using Eqs.~(\ref{eq:clscalar}) and (\ref{eq:clbb}), performed with the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB, \cite{Lewis:1999bs}), are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:clall}. Results for the temperature and E-mode spectra are given by the black and red lines, respectively, while the result for the tensor B-mode spectrum is given by the blue lines for two possible values of $r$. Also shown are predictions for the B-mode spectrum generated by gravitational lensing of E modes (green line). B-mode signal shape and detection prospects, as well as contamination mitigation, will be discussed further in the next section.  Finally, the data points in Fig.~\ref{fig:clall} show current constraints on the B-mode power from lensing, residual foreground, and potentially primordial gravitational waves from { BICEP}2/{\it Keck Array} \cite{Ade:2015fwj}, POLARBEAR~\cite{Ade:2014afa}, and SPTpol \cite{Keisler:2015hfa}.

At present, bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the temperature and E-mode anisotropies are comparable to those from B-mode observations \cite{Ade:2013uln,Ade:2015lrj}. The temperature constraints are now cosmic variance-limited, and the E-mode constraints are approaching that level.  However, there is no such limit on the B-modes, so that improvements (and a potential detection) with CMB-S4 will rely on measurements of $C_\ell^{BB}$ -- most likely targeting the degree-scale ``recombination'' feature in the primordial B-mode spectrum. 
%which is easier to access from the ground than the ``reionization'' feature on larger angular scales ($\ell < 10$).

%Constraints on the amplitude of primordial tensor modes already strongly disfavor once popular inflationary models, such as minimally-coupled chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential. In the next section we will discuss in detail what a detection of primordial gravitational waves would imply for theories of the early Universe. 

%Although the B-mode power spectrum is a major focus, it is not the only inflationary observable.CMB-S4 will also improve constraints on the scalar spectral index and running, $dn_{\rm s}/d\ln k$, which will further limit the model space. Beyond the power spectra, testing the Gaussianity of the scalar fluctuations has been a powerful means to constrain the allowed particle content and interactions of viable inflation models \cite{Ade:2013ydc,Ade:2015ava}. Studies of non-Gaussianity in the primordial fluctuations provide probes of the interacting quantum field theory of inflation, in many ways analogous to the data collected in particle colliders. Current constraints on scalar non-Gaussianity come from temperature and E-mode polarization, and can be improved by additional data from CMB-S4. In addition, a detection of primordial B-modes would allow significant new tests for higher-order correlations, probing the particles that contribute to sourcing primordial gravitational waves. Although challenging, such measurements offer independent ways of ruling out classes of inflationary model.

\section{Sensitivity forecasts for $r$}
\label{sec:needs}

Achieving the CMB-S4 target sensitivity of $\sigma(r) \sim 10^{-3}$ will require exquisite measurements of the B-mode power spectrum. 
It is expected that CMB-S4 will target the degree-scale recombination feature rather than the tens-of-degree-scale reionization feature (see Fig.~\ref{fig:clall}), because these largest scales are difficult to access from the ground due to atmosphere and sidelobe pickup (though some Stage-3 ground-based experiments are attempting this measurement, notably CLASS \cite{Essinger-Hileman:2014pja}).

As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:clall}, the first requirement for this level of sensitivity to $r$ is a substantial leap forward in raw instrument sensitivity. 
%As detailed in Section~\ref{sec:detectors}, f
For ground-based bolometric detectors, which are individually limited in sensitivity by the random arrival of background photons, this means a large increase in detector count. 
The forecasts in this section use a baseline of 250,000 detectors operating for four years (or $10^6$ detector years), dedicated solely to maximizing sensitivity to $r$. 
It will be necessary to split this total effort among many electromagnetic frequencies, to separate the CMB from polarized Galactic foregrounds. % that dominate at these angular scales.
The forecasts here assume eight frequency bands, ranging from 30 to 270\,GHz.
Contamination from gravitationally lensed E modes must also be mitigated.
While a precise prediction for the cosmological mean of the lensing B-mode power spectrum can be made and subtracted from the observed spectrum, there will be a sample variance residual between this prediction and the real lensing B-modes on a particular patch of sky.
To suppress this sample variance, it will be necessary to ``delens'' the B-mode maps with a prediction for the lensing signal from that particular patch of sky, constructed from the E-mode map and some tracer of the lensing potential (see Section~\ref{delens} for details).
Forecasts in this section assign part of the total detector count to a dedicated delensing effort, assumed to be a large-aperture ($\ge 6$-meter) telescope at a single frequency
(see below for a discussion of assumptions about aperture size).
Finally, from the relative amplitudes of the temperature, E-mode, and B-mode power spectra, it is clear that instrumental systematics that mix temperature or E-mode power into B-modes must also be controlled to an extremely low level. 
To account for real-world inefficiencies, including non-ideal detector performance and yield, observing efficiency, bad weather, data filtering, and cuts, the forecasts in this section use scaled versions of achieved power-spectrum covariance matrices from the { BICEP}2/{\em Keck Array} experiments.
This conservative assumption accounts for many difficult to quantify factors that result in worse constraints on r than a naive, raw-sensitivity calculation would imply.
Further details of the forecasting methodology, including assumptions regarding foreground properties and delensing efficiency, can be found in Section~\ref{sec_specforecast}.
Fig.~\ref{fig_clBBr01} shows some of the inputs to and assumptions of the forecasting code, including foregrounds, B-mode spectrum error bars (including sample variance on the $r=0.01$ spectrum for 3\% of the sky and noise variance using the scaled noise covariance for the default detector count), and delensing efficiency (the value shown is appropriate for 3\% of the sky, $r=0.01$, and the default detector count -- see below for details).

The trade-off between raw sensitivity, ability to remove foregrounds, and ability to delens results in a complicated optimization problem with respect to sky coverage.
Fig.~\ref{fig_rforecast1} shows the $r$ sensitivity forecast for CMB-S4 as a function of the observed sky fraction for the case that we only have an upper limit (i.e.\ assuming $r=0$, left) or for the case of a detection (here assuming $r=0.01$, right).
Focusing on the $r=0$ case, we see that an effort devoted to an initial detection of $r$ will benefit from a deep survey that targets a small sky area.
In fact, there is no minimum in Fig.~\ref{fig_rforecast1}; taken at face value, this optimization drives us to as small a sky fraction as possible. 
Several real-world constraints caution against this extreme interpretation, the most important of which is the level to which we will rely on delensing at the smallest sky fractions.
For example, as shown in the bottom-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig_rforecast1}, achieving the forecasted sensitivity to $r$ for a survey targeting 1\% of the sky will require an 80\% reduction in the map r.m.s. level of the CMB lensing B-modes. 
While this is achievable from a sensitivity standpoint (see Section~\ref{delens}), systematics and foregrounds will need to be carefully considered.
There are other real-world concerns not completely captured in the forecasting code that would work in the other direction, steepening the optimization curve at high sky fractions.
For now we assume identical foreground behavior in all parts of the sky (equivalent to the measured behavior in the { BICEP}2/{\em Keck Array} region), while in fact the average amplitude -- and possibly the complexity -- of foregrounds will increase as larger sky fractions are targeted \cite{Adam:2014bub,Aghanim:2016cps}.
%Concerns about foreground complexity beyond what has been simulated 
This effect might appear to increase our preference for a small area survey that focuses on the cleanest regions; however, we need to be cautious until we know more about foregrounds at these sensitivity levels.
Likewise, our ability to identify and address instrumental systematics is often limited by the noise level of the maps, so deeper maps can serve as a guard against instrumental problems.
% (\comment{Would be helpful to refine this argument with a simple model.}).
Balancing the forecasting results with these real-world concerns, for subsequent plots we have chosen 3\% as the default sky fraction for CMB-S4 $r$ constraints (assuming a true value of $r=0$).

The preference for small sky area is in tension with other CMB-S4 science goals that prefer large sky areas but have much lower requirements for foreground cleaning.
To balance these goals, we assume that roughly one half of the total CMB-S4 experiment is devoted to a deep survey targeting degree-scale B-modes, while the other half is spent on a broad survey.
However, if an important science goal was slightly out of the reach of the default survey, one could consider increasing the effort spent on constraining $r$.
Fig.~\ref{fig_rforecast2} shows the forecasted sensitivity to $r$ as a function of the total effort spent on the deep survey.
With 250,000 detectors operating for four years, CMB-S4 will exceed the $\sigma(r)=0.001$ benchmark, again assuming a true value of $r=0$.

If the true value of $r$ is not zero, the optimum survey strategy and detector effort will change.
As shown in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig_rforecast1}, if $r$ is as large as 0.01, then a larger sky area will be needed to improve precision; thus, the CMB-S4 deep survey must be designed with the flexibility to increase sky area in the event of a detection.

%For all scenarios, the inflation survey will require many observing frequencies.
%These forecasts include eight frequency bands distributed between the four atmospheric windows.
%While it may be desirable to measure 
In these forecasts, it is assumed that the degree-scale CMB and foregrounds are measured using small-aperture telescopes, while the delensing is achieved with a separate, large-aperture telescope. 
In all combinations of sky fraction and total detector effort, these forecasts indicate that at least 10--35\% of the total effort must be spent on high-resolution maps that can be used for delensing.
If the large-aperture, high-resolution data can also be used for degree-scale science, the allocation of resources between bands and telescopes would change slightly, and the overall constraints on $r$ would improve. 
If, furthermore, cost per detector were independent of telescope aperture size, an argument could be made to carry out all the science with large-aperture telescopes. 
Neither of these assumptions is clearly supported by current data, however.

Finally, we note that we have validated the results of the primary Fisher forecasting code used in this section with two other codes, one Fisher-based and one map-based. 
For several individual points in sky-fraction and detector-effort parameter space (and using a common set of assumptions about observing bands and noise per detector), the three independent codes return consistent values of $\sigma(r)$.
Worth noting in particular is that the map-based forecasting code does not assume purely Gaussian-distributed foreground emission or translationally invariant foreground properties; rather, foregrounds are simulated in map space based on currently available data.
The agreement between the map-based approach and the power-spectrum-based approaches provides reassurance that the foreground-mitigation approach in the design of CMB-S4 (in particular the number of observing bands and their placement in frequency) is adequate.

\section{Implications of a detection of primordial gravitational waves}
\label{sec:detection}

The inflationary amplification of vacuum fluctuations of the metric leads to a nearly scale-invariant, very nearly Gaussian tensor power spectrum. This signal is very well characterized by a single parameter defining the (relative) amplitude of tensor fluctuations, $r$. In this section, we consider the consequences of a detection of primordial gravitational waves consistent with this simplest inflationary expectation. Together with implications of an improved upper limit on $r$ presented in the next section, these expectations motivate the threshold level of sensitivity CMB-S4 will aspire to and guide the baseline proposals for the instrument in Section~\ref{sec:needs}. 

Of course, if a detection is achieved it will be essential to characterize the accuracy with which we can test the standard inflationary prediction. In Section~\ref{sec:beyond_r} we will use the baseline instrument design from Section~\ref{sec:needs} with hypothetical detection levels to forecast constraints on $n_{\rm t}$ and tensor-mode non-Gaussianity. We also use Section~\ref{sec:beyond_r} to discuss alternatives to the inflationary vacuum prediction, including non-vacuum sources during inflation. We will see that non-vacuum scenarios would be distinguishable, as long as $r$ is detected at high significance.

The remainder of this section derives the remarkable implications of a detection of primordial gravitational waves with amplitude accessible by CMB-S4, and with a nearly scale-invariant, nearly Gaussian spectrum.  This would reveal the energy scale of inflation, provide compelling evidence for linearized quantum gravity, and yield strong support for structure in non-linear quantum gravity that accommodates a large field range for the inflaton. 

\subsection{The energy scale of inflation}
\label{sec:scale-of-inflation}
According to the inflationary prediction for the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves, Eq.~(\ref{eq:inf_Pt}), a detection provides a direct measurement of the Hubble scale during inflation. In single-field slow-roll models the Friedmann equation relates the Hubble scale to the potential energy $V$ of the inflaton, $3H^2M_{\rm P}^2\simeq V$. The inflationary prediction for the amplitude of scalar fluctuations, Eq.~(\ref{eq:inf_Pzeta}) can be used to write $H$ in terms of the measured amplitude and the so-far undetermined slow-roll parameter, $\epsilon$. Since $\epsilon$ is directly proportional to the tensor-to-scalar ratio this allows us to express the energy scale of inflation in terms of measured numbers, known constants, and $r$ (all at the pivot scale $k_\ast=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Vofr}
V^{1/4}=1.04\times 10^{16}{\rm GeV}\left(\frac{r_\ast}{0.01}\right)^{1/4}\,.
\end{equation}
A detection of primordial gravitational waves therefore determines the energy scale of inflation to within a few per cent. 

{\it A detection of primordial gravitational waves by CMB-S4 would reveal a new scale of particle physics, near the GUT scale. In the event that the signal is reasonably scale-invariant and at most weakly non-Gaussian, this scale corresponds to the energy scale of inflation.} 
%When this is not the case a detection would imply richer phenomenology within the inflationary sector.}

%{\bf Should we address these papers at all: 1410.8845, rebutted in 1508.01527, re-rebutted in 1510.06759, (different author) 1510.07956?}

%\subsection{Primordial gravitational waves and quantum gravity}
%{\bf Need to decide what to say here. Some possible things to address:} As with scalar fluctuations, we're detecting classical correlations, not quantum, and we're not detecting gravitons. Also, we're only indirectly detecting primordial grav. waves, not direct detection like LIGO. So, what exactly do we mean when we say that B-modes provide strong evidence for the linear quantization of gravity? We can quantize gravity consistently using an effective field theory approach. This should be valid well below the Planck scale -- we have no reason to think it shouldn't work. Inflation produces primordial gravitational waves in this framework. At the linear level, it's not clear how much a classical observation consistent with this picture means. Freeman Dyson is perhaps (?) the person with the most to say about this, claiming that even in principle an individual graviton cannot be measured. The next sub-section talks about an implication for full, non-linear quantum gravity: an inference based on how we understand effective theories at much lower energies and linear quantum gravity in string theory.
%
\subsection{Planckian field ranges and symmetries}
The spectrum of tensor fluctuations depends only on the Hubble parameter $H$ during inflation, while the scalar power depends on both $H$ and the evolution of the homogeneous field sourcing inflation. As a consequence, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ determines the inflaton field range in Planck units (called the ``Lyth bound'' \cite{Lyth:1996im})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Lyth}
\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}=\int_0^{\mathcal{N}_\ast}d\mathcal{N}\,\left(\frac{r}{8}\right)^{1/2}\,,
\end{equation}
where (applying the general equation to the observationally accessible regime) $\mathcal{N}_\ast$ is the number of e-folds between the end of inflation and the moment when the mode with $k_\ast=0.05\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ (corresponding to the CMB pivot scale) exits the horizon. In many common inflationary models $r$ is a monotonic function of $\mathcal{N}$ so that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lbound}
\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}\gtrsim \left(\frac{r_\ast}{8}\right)^{1/2}\mathcal{N}_\ast\gtrsim \left(\frac{r}{0.01}\right)^{1/2}\,.
\end{equation}  
The value of $\mathcal{N}_\ast$ is not well constrained and depends on unknown details of reheating, but $\mathcal{N}_\ast\gtrsim 30$ provides a conservative lower limit, justifying the second inequality in Eq.~(\ref{eq:lbound}). Thus, a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r>10^{-2}$ typically corresponds to a trans-Planckian excursion in field space between the end of inflation and the epoch when the modes we observe in the CMB exit the horizon.

The relationship in Eq.~(\ref{eq:lbound}) is significant because it relates the observed amplitude of linearized metric fluctuations to a property of the full quantum field theory for gravity plus the inflaton. The action describing inflation, like the action for any other particle physics phenomena, in general will have a structure that includes quantum contributions from degrees of freedom that couple to the inflaton, but are too energetic to be probed directly by physics near the inflationary scale. The field range is a measure of the distance in field space over which those quantum corrections do not significantly change, since otherwise slow-roll inflation would not persist. Since the Planck scale is the highest scale where new structure from quantum gravity degrees of freedom can enter, a Planckian field range would imply that quantum gravity contributions do not significantly change over the naively expected scale. A detection of $r$ would therefore provide very strong motivation to better understand how ``large-field inflation" can be naturally incorporated in quantum gravity. %Furthermore, this inflationary signal has the potential to challenge (or unify) some approaches to quantum gravity because it involves not just a quantization of the degrees of freedom in the Einstein-Hilbert term, but also probes the coupling between matter and gravity in the fully non-linear, quantum regime.

To understand this more quantitatively, recall that unless we work in a UV-complete theory such as string theory, we rely on an effective field theory description of the inflationary epoch. General relativity, viewed as an effective field theory, breaks down as energies approach the Planck scale because interactions between gravitons become strongly coupled. The same is true for matter coupled to general relativity, so that the effective field theory governing the inflationary period will generically have a sub-Planckian cut-off $\Lambda_{\rm UV}<M_{\rm P}$. In fact, in any weakly-coupled UV completion of general relativity the new degrees of freedom must enter well below the Planck scale to ensure weak coupling so that $\Lambda_{\rm UV}\ll M_{\rm P}$. 
%Although we do not know the complete theory of quantum gravity, our understanding of the implications of the Lyth bound are based on experience with effective field theories at much lower scales, borne out in relation to quantum gravity through models of inflation in string theory.
According to the bound in Eq.~(\ref{eq:lbound}), a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r>10^{-2}$ (and even somewhat smaller) requires a displacement in field space that is larger than the cut-off of the effective field theory. While this does not invalidate an effective field theory description, it has important consequences. Assuming that the UV-complete theory is known, the effective field theory is obtained by integrating out all modes parametrically heavier than the cut-off $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ of the single-field model. In the absence of symmetries, we expect the inflaton $\phi$ to couple to heavy degrees of freedom $\chi$ that, once integrated out, will introduce significant structure in the potential for the inflation on scales $\Delta\phi\ll \Lambda_{\rm UV}$. For example, consider the action
\begin{equation}\label{eq:action}
S=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\left[-\frac12g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi-\frac12g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\chi\partial_\nu\chi-\frac12m^2\phi^2-\frac12M^2\chi^2-\frac12\mu\phi\chi^2+\dots\right]\,.
\end{equation}
By assumption, the mass of the heavy degrees of freedom to be integrated out is $M\gtrsim\Lambda_{\rm UV}$, and the dots represent various other interaction terms. Generically the dimensionful coupling $\mu$ is also expected to be of order the cut-off, $\mu\sim\Lambda_{\rm UV}$. From the last two terms in Eq.~(\ref{eq:action}), we see that displacements of $\phi$ by a distance comparable to the cut-off may lead to cancellations in the effective mass of the heavy degrees of freedom, and heavy states (in this case $\chi$) may become light if $\phi$ is displaced by a distance large compared to the cut-off. In particular, since $\Lambda_{\rm UV}<M_{\rm P}$ we should not expect potentials that are smooth over super-Planckian distances in a generic low energy effective field theory with cut-off $\Lambda_{\rm UV}<M_{\rm P}$. 

We can only expect potentials suitable for large-field inflation if some mass scales (in the example $m$ and $\mu$) are well below the cut-off, or if dimensionless couplings are small. This occurs naturally if the UV theory respects a weakly broken shift symmetry $\phi\rightarrow\phi+c$, which ensures that quantum corrections from the inflaton and graviton will not introduce large corrections to the inflationary Lagrangian \cite{Linde:2005ht, Kaloper:2011jz, Csaki:2014bua,Kaplan:2015fuy,Choi:2015fiu}. At the level of an effective field theory we can simply postulate such an approximate shift symmetry, but one should keep in mind that we ultimately require the existence of such a symmetry in quantum gravity. 

As the best developed theory of quantum gravity, string theory is a useful framework for exploring mechanisms that allow large-field inflation to be realized, even in the presence of heavy degrees of freedom. Axions are ubiquitous in string theory and provide natural candidates for the inflaton because they enjoy a shift symmetry that is weakly broken by instanton effects as well as by the presence of branes or fluxes~\cite{Wen:1985jz}. Early field theory models relied on the familiar periodic contributions to the potential generated by instantons to drive inflation~\cite{Freese:1990rb,Adams:1992bn}. In string theory the periods are expected to be sub-Planckian~\cite{Banks:2003sx,ArkaniHamed:2006dz}, while constraints on the scalar spectral index require super-Planckian axion periods, so that a UV completion of these models does not currently exist. The excitement over the initial { BICEP}2 results \cite{Ade:2014xna} led to renewed interest in models in which the inflaton is an axion with a potential that is entirely due to instanton effects and intensified the discussion about the extent to which some means to achieve large-field inflation via multiple axions may be incompatible with basic principles of quantum gravity \cite{Kim:2004rp,Rudelius:2014wla,delaFuente:2014aca,Rudelius:2015xta,Brown:2015iha,Bachlechner:2015qja,Brown:2015lia,Heidenreich:2015wga,Heidenreich:2015nta,Kooner:2015rza}.

%As the best developed theory of quantum gravity, string theory is a useful framework for exploring mechanisms that allow large-field inflation to be realized even in the presence of heavy degrees of freedom. Axions provide natural candidates for the inflaton~\cite{Freese:1990rb,Adams:1992bn}. They are ubiquitous in string theory and enjoy a shift symmetry that is weakly broken by instanton effects as well as the presence of branes or fluxes~\cite{Wen:1985jz}. Instanton effects generate periodic contributions to the potential. While the periodicities in string theory are expected to be sub-Planckian~\cite{Banks:2003sx,ArkaniHamed:2006dz}, constraints on the scalar spectral index require super-Planckian axion decay constants so that a UV completion of these models does not currently exist. The claimed detection of primordial B-modes by BICEP2 has led to renewed interest in models in which the inflaton is an axion with a potential that is entirely due to instanton effects, and has intensified the discussion to what extent some means to achieve large-field inflation via multiple axions may be incompatible with basic principles of quantum gravity \cite{Kim:2004rp,Rudelius:2014wla,delaFuente:2014aca,Rudelius:2015xta,Brown:2015iha,Bachlechner:2015qja,Brown:2015lia,Heidenreich:2015wga,Heidenreich:2015nta,Kooner:2015rza}.


In addition to the familiar non-perturbative contributions that break the continuous shift symmetry to a discrete one, the presence of fluxes and branes lead to contributions to the axion potentials that break the discrete shift symmetry as well. As the axion is displaced by one period, one unit of charge is induced, so that the axion field space becomes non-compact. As a consequence, super-Planckian decay constants are not required for super-Planckian excursions in these so-called ``monodromy'' models~\cite{Silverstein:2008sg, McAllister:2008hb, Kaloper:2008fb, Berg:2009tg, Palti:2014kza,McAllister:2014mpa, Marchesano:2014mla, Blumenhagen:2015xpa,Hebecker:2015tzo}. Generically both contributions to the potential are present and these models predict periodic effects at some level, either directly from the periodic features in the potential or from periodic bursts of string or particle production. Unfortunately, the strength of the signal is very model-dependent; even if one of these models is a good approximation to nature, the periodic features could be undetectably small even for CMB-S4.

In writing Eq.~(\ref{eq:lbound}), we have assumed that $r$ is monotonic, or at least of the same order of magnitude throughout the inflationary period. However, one can easily construct models in which $r$ is non-monotonic to weaken the bound~\cite{BenDayan:2009kv,Hotchkiss:2011gz, Chatterjee:2014hna}. In the case of a detection with CMB-S4 of a spectrum that is at least approximately scale-invariant, we can write the weaker bound
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}\gtrsim\left(\frac{r}{0.3}\right)^{1/2}\,,
\end{equation}
which limits the distance in field space traveled during the time the modes we observe in the CMB exited the horizon. This inequality shows that even if the distance in field space traveled during this period is sub-Planckian, it is not parametrically smaller than $M_{\rm P}$. 
%Because general relativity is not UV-complete and becomes strongly coupled at $M_{\rm P}$, any weakly-coupled UV completion will come with a scale of new physics $M$, e.g. the string scale, which must be parametrically smaller than the Planck scale to ensure weak coupling. 
This implies that we cannot avoid the question of the embedding of the inflation model into quantum gravity for $r=0.01$ or even for $r=0.005$, unless we assume that the UV completion of general relativity is strongly coupled. These levels of primordial gravitational waves can be detected at high significance with CMB-S4 as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_clBBr01} and Fig.~\ref{fig:nsrp01} for a fiducial model of $r=0.01$.

%Equation (\ref{eq:Lyth}) can be used to determine a useful theoretical threshold for $r$ that would allow the most robust conclusion about the field range of the inflaton. Give the possibility that $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ may be slightly below $M_{\rm P}$, and the desire for true parametric control of corrections rather than accidental cancellations, we will define small-field inflation as requiring $\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}\ll1$ (in contrast to perhaps half the literature where the line is drawn at $\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}=1$). The total number of e-folds needed to put the largest scales in causal contact depends on the reheating temperature, but since the integrand in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Lyth}) is always positive, we can use constraints on the $\simeq 7$ e-folds constrained by current CMB observations to provide a conservative bound. The evolution of $r$ during inflation is model dependent, but as a simple starting point consider canonical single-field slow-roll inflation where the consistency relation between $r$ and $n_{\rm t}$ to write $d\ln r/d\mathcal{N}=-(n_{\rm s}-1)-\frac{r}{8}$. The variation of this quantity is second-order in slow-roll parameters, so as a first pass we may take it to be constant and use the {\it Planck\/} satellite constraints assuming constant $n_{\rm s}$ (and allowing a $3\,\sigma$ interval) to find
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}\ll1\Rightarrow r\lesssim0.002.
%\end{equation}
%Allowing the spectral index to run, we may use the second-order consistency relation $d\ln r/d\mathcal{N}=-\frac{r}{8}(n_{\rm s}-1+\frac{r}{8})$ and {\it Planck\/} constraints to find 
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}\ll1\Rightarrow r\lesssim0.0015.
%\end{equation}
%One might try to construct scenarios where the evolution of the tensor-to-scalar ratio violates slow-roll sufficiently to allow inflation scenarios with $\frac{\Delta\phi}{M_{\rm P}}\ll1$ to generate $r\sim\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ or higher \cite{BenDayan:2009kv,Hotchkiss:2011gz, Chatterjee:2014hna}. These attempts are under considerable pressure from {\it Planck\/} observations. {\bf Can we add a the stronger statement here?} 

In deriving the primordial power spectra and Eq.~(\ref{eq:Lyth}), we have assumed the Bunch-Davies vacuum state \cite{Bunch:1978yq}. The relation between $r$ and the scale of inflation is modified if we assume that the tensor  modes (and the scalar modes) either do not start in the Bunch-Davies state~\cite{Ashoorioon:2014nta,Collins:2014yua}, or that the evolution during inflation will lead to departures from it. The first option generically introduces a stronger scale-dependence into the tensor spectrum \cite{Aravind:2014axa,Flauger:2013hra} (and additional non-Gaussianity). In addition, this way of achieving observable primordial B-modes from a low-scale model has a similar feature to large-field models: one should show that the initial state is not only acceptable from the point of view of low-energy considerations, but can be generated by pre-inflationary physics. The second option (discussed in section~\ref{sec:scale-of-inflation}) leads to non-trivial higher $n$-point functions that are in principle measurable.

{\it A conclusive detection of primordial B-modes with CMB-S4 would provide evidence that the theory of quantum gravity must accommodate a Planckian field range for the inflaton. Conversely, the absence of a detection of B-modes with CMB-S4 will mean that a large field range is not required. The relation between inflaton field range and the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves means that a detection of $r$ would provide an observational window into non-linear quantum gravity.}


\section{Implications of an improved upper limit on $r$} 
\label{sec:upperLimits}
As detailed in previous sections, a detection of primordial gravitational waves would have profound implications; however, even excluding the presence of gravitational waves at a level observable by CMB-S4 would have important consequences for the theory of inflation. Current constraints already strongly disfavor models that were plausible candidates, such as chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential~\cite{Ade:2015lrj,Ade:2015tva,Array:2015xqh}. Upper limits from CMB-S4 would rule out entire classes of inflationary models. This is shown in figure~\ref{fig:nsr0}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Forecast of CMB-S4 constraints in the $n_{\rm s}$--$r$ plane for a fiducial model with $r=0$. Constraints

Longer dashes correspond to larger values of the scale $M$.

\label{fig:nsr0}
\end{figure}

We first present a version of an argument for the implications of an $r$ detection, developed in Refs.~\cite{Mukhanov:2013tua,Roest:2013fha,Creminelli:2014nqa}, which does not rely on the microscopic details of inflationary models. In the limit where the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon\ll1$, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:inf_Pzeta}) and~(\ref{eq:specind}) lead to a differential equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:epsdiffeq}
\frac{d\ln\epsilon}{d\mathcal{N}}-(n_{\rm s}(\mathcal{N})-1)-2\epsilon=0\,,
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal{N}$ is the number of e-folds until the end of inflation, and $n_{\rm s}(\mathcal{N})-1$ denotes the spectral index evaluated at the wavenumber of the mode that exits the horizon $\mathcal{N}$ e-folds before the end of inflation. Note that $\epsilon$ is small (but positive) during inflation and $\epsilon\sim 1$ when inflation ends. If $\epsilon$ is a monotonic function of $\mathcal{N}$ this implies $n_{\rm s}(\mathcal{N})-1\leq 0$, in agreement with observations. 

Denoting by $\mathcal{N}_\ast$ the number of e-folds before the end of inflation at which the CMB pivot scale exits the horizon, the departure from a scale-invariant spectrum observed by the {\it Planck\/} satellite is $\mathcal{O}(1/\mathcal{N}_\ast)$. While this could be a coincidence, it would find a natural explanation if 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nsassump}
n_{\rm s}(\mathcal{N})-1=-\frac{p+1}{\mathcal{N}}\,,
\end{equation}
up to subleading corrections in an expansion in large $\mathcal{N}$ for some real $p$. Under this assumption, the general solution to Eq.~(\ref{eq:epsdiffeq}) is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:epssol}
\epsilon(\mathcal{N})=\frac{p}{2\mathcal{N}}\frac{1}{1\pm\left(\mathcal{N}/\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\right)^{p}}\,,
\end{equation}
where we have chosen to parameterize the integration constant by $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$ so that the magnitudes of the first and second terms in the denominator become equal when $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$. We take $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}>0$ and indicate the choice of sign for the integration constant by ``$\pm$.''

Assuming that the epoch when the modes we observe in the CMB exit the horizon is not special, so that $\mathcal{N}_\ast\gg\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$ or $\mathcal{N}_\ast\ll\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:epsdiffeq}) leads to four classes of solution:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm I.}&&\epsilon(\mathcal{N})=\frac{p}{2\mathcal{N}}\,;\label{eq:classI}\\
{\rm II.}&&\epsilon(\mathcal{N})=\frac{p}{2\mathcal{N}}\left(\frac{\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}}{\mathcal{N}}\right)^p\hspace{1.92cm}\qquad{\rm with}\qquad \hspace{7.3mm}p>0 \hspace{1.0cm}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\ll\mathcal{N}_\ast\,;\label{eq:classII}\\
{\rm III.}&&\epsilon(\mathcal{N})=\frac{|p|}{2\mathcal{N}}\left(\frac{\mathcal{N}}{\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}}\right)^{|p|}\hspace{1.77cm}\qquad{\rm with}\qquad \hspace{7.3mm}p<0 \hspace{1.0cm}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\gg\mathcal{N}_\ast\,;\label{eq:classIII}\\
{\rm IV.}&&\epsilon(\mathcal{N})=\frac{1}{2\mathcal{N}\ln\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}/\mathcal{N}}+\frac{p}{4\mathcal{N}}+\dots\qquad{\rm with}\qquad |p|\ll\frac{1}{\ln\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}/\mathcal{N}_\ast}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad \mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\gg\mathcal{N}_\ast\,.\label{eq:classIV}
\end{eqnarray}

We will see that $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$ sets the characteristic scale in the potential. As we explain in what follows, if CMB-S4 does {\it not\/} detect primordial B-modes, only class II with $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\lesssim 1$ will remain viable, while the other cases will be disfavored or excluded. This would amount to excluding all models that naturally explain the spectral index with a characteristic scale that exceeds the Planck scale. 

The value of $\mathcal{N}_\ast$ depends on the post-inflationary history of the Universe. Equation~(\ref{eq:nsassump}) implies that a measurement of the spectral index and its running would determine $p$ and hence $\mathcal{N}_\ast$, but unfortunately a measurement of the running at the level of $(n_{\rm s}-1)^2$ is out of reach for CMB-S4. A given reheating scenario predicts $\mathcal{N}_\ast$, but the space of reheating scenarios is large. Instantaneous reheating leads to $\mathcal{N}_\ast\simeq 57$ for $k_\ast=0.05\,  {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, while smaller values correspond to less efficient reheating. We will assume $47<\mathcal{N}_\ast<57$ for the following discussion. 

Current constraints on $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ from Ref.~\cite{Ade:2015tva} disfavor class III at just over $2\,\sigma$ relative to class II. Furthermore, the best-fit point of class III occurs for $p\simeq 0$, where classes I, II, and III are degenerate, so that class III need not be discussed separately. Additionally class IV is disfavored at 2--$3\,\sigma$ relative to class II. As a consequence we focus on classes I and II in what follows.

For class I, constraints from the {\it Planck\/} satellite and the { BICEP}2/{\em Keck Array} experiments~\cite{Ade:2015tva} translate into $p=0.32\pm0.16$ at $1\,\sigma$, and favor models with inefficient reheating. At the best-fit point in this class, $r=0.044$ and $n_{\rm s}=0.973$, which is currently disfavored relative to class II at 1--$2\,\sigma$. Upper limits on $r$ directly translate into constraints on $p$. A $1\,\sigma$ upper limit on the amount of primordial gravitational waves from CMB-S4 at a level of $r<0.001$ would imply $p<0.013$ and effectively rule out this class as it degenerates into class II in this limit. 

For class II the tensor-to-scalar ratio is naturally smaller than in class I, as long as $p$ is of order unity because $\mathcal{N}_\ast\gg\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$. Under the additional assumption that the scaling of Eq.~(\ref{eq:classII}) should be valid until the end of inflation we have $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\simeq 1$. In this case, current data from Ref.~\cite{Ade:2015tva} imply $p=0.67\pm0.24$ after marginalization over $\mathcal{N}_\ast$. The best-fit point occurs at $p=0.83$ and instantaneous reheating, so that in this class the data favors models with efficient reheating. At the best-fit point, $r=0.004$ and $n_{\rm s}=0.968$. An upper limit of $r<0.001$ would disfavor this scenario relative to scenarios with $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\ll 1$ at approximately $2\,\sigma$. The precise significance depends slightly on the true value of the spectral index. Similarly, for an upper limit of $r<0.001$, the regime with $p\ll1$ (and equivalently class I) would be disfavored relative to class II with $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\ll 1$ at $3\,\sigma$. To disfavor the scenario with $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\simeq 1$ at approximately $3\,\sigma$ relative to $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\ll 1$ would require an upper limit of $r\lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$.  

In summary, in the absence of a detection of primordial gravitational waves, CMB-S4 would place constraints on $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ that are strong enough to rule out or disfavor all models that naturally explain the observed value of the scalar spectral index in the sense that $n_{\rm s}(\mathcal{N})-1\propto 1/\mathcal{N}$ and in which the behavior of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:classI})--(\ref{eq:classIV}) provides a good approximation until the end of inflation. 

To understand the implications better, let us discuss the models that underlie the classes favored by current data, classes I and II. The  potentials can be obtained from 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\phi}{d\mathcal{N}}=M_{\rm P}^2\frac{V'}{V}\qquad{\rm and}\qquad \left(\frac{d\phi}{d\mathcal{N}}\right)^2=2\epsilon M_{\rm P}^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm P}$ is the reduced Planck mass.

Class I corresponds to models of chaotic inflation with monomial potentials, $V(\phi)=\mu^{4-2p}\phi^{2p}$,
as already considered in~Ref.~\cite{Linde:1983gd}. The most commonly studied examples were $p=1,2$, both of which are now ruled out or strongly constrained~\cite{Ade:2015tva}. Models with fractional powers $1/3<p<1$ that are still viable candidates have naturally appeared in the study of large-field models of inflation in string theory~\cite{Silverstein:2008sg,McAllister:2008hb,Flauger:2009ab}. If gravitational waves are not observed with CMB-S4, these would be ruled out.

Provided $p\neq 1$, class II corresponds to potentials of the form 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:classIIpot}
V(\phi)=V_0\exp\left[-\left(\frac{\phi}{\Lambda}\right)^{\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right]\,,
\end{equation}
with $\Lambda=\sqrt{\alpha(p)\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}}M_{\rm P}$, where $\alpha(p)=4p/(1-p)^2$. The parameter $\Lambda$ is closely related to the characteristic scale of the potential $M$. For the range of $p$ that corresponds to the observed value of $n_{\rm s}$, it is well approximated by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potscale}
M=\Lambda\frac{|1-p|}{p}\,.
\end{equation}
For $p>1$ inflation occurs when $\phi\ll \Lambda$. In this regime, the potential behaves like a hilltop model, $V(\phi)\simeq V_0(1-\left(\phi/\Lambda\right)^n)$, with $n=2p/(p-1)$. For $0<p<1$ inflation occurs for $\phi\gg \Lambda$ and $V(\phi)\simeq V_0(1-\left(\Lambda/\phi\right)^n)$ with $n=2p/(1-p)$. In the limit $p\to0$, in which classes I, II, and III become degenerate, the $\phi$-dependence is logarithmic. 

For the special case $p=1$ the dependence on the inflaton in Eq.~(\ref{eq:classIIpot}) becomes exponential, and in the inflationary regime the potential is well approximated by $V(\phi)\simeq V_0\left(1-\exp\left(-\phi/M\right)\right)$ with $M=\sqrt{\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}}M_{\rm P}$. There are many examples of models with a potential with this asymptotic behavior for $\phi\gg M$. These include the Starobinsky model~\cite{Starobinsky:1980te}, Higgs inflation~\cite{Salopek:1988qh,Bezrukov:2007ep}, an early example of chaotic inflation~\cite{Goncharov:1983mw}, and the T-model~\cite{Kallosh:2013hoa}.

If only the asymptotic forms of the potentials agree with Eq.~(\ref{eq:classIIpot}), then Eq.~(\ref{eq:nsassump}) will not be exact and the departures from Eq.~(\ref{eq:classIIpot}) will be encoded in the subleading terms that vanish more rapidly than $1/\mathcal{N}$ in the limit $\mathcal{N}\to\infty$. Unfortunately, just like the running of the scalar spectral index, the subleading contributions are typically too small to be detected.

Note that $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$ sets the characteristic scale in field space. For $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}$ of order unity, the variation of the inflaton is naturally given in units of the reduced Planck mass, while for $\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}\ll 1$ the characteristic scale in field space is sub-Planckian. 

This allows us to rephrase the lesson we can draw from an upper limit on $r$ from CMB-S4 as follows:

{\em In the absence of a detection, CMB-S4 would rule out or disfavor all models that naturally explain the observed value of the scalar spectral index and in which the characteristic scale in field space exceeds the Planck scale.}

Unfortunately, because of the scaling $M\propto \sqrt{\mathcal{N}_{\rm eq}}$ it will only be possible to place constraints $M\lesssim M_{\rm P}$, but not $M\ll M_{\rm P}$. It should also be kept in mind that a natural explanation of the value of the scalar spectral index is not guaranteed and its value could be an accident. That a natural explanation is possible is, however, encouraging.

\section{Tensor-mode science beyond $r$}
\label{sec:beyond_r}

If a detection of primordial gravitational waves is made with CMB-S4, the next step would be to understand the possible sources of the signal. The spectrum of B-modes from vacuum fluctuations of the metric, amplified by inflation driven by a scalar field, is nearly scale-invariant and very nearly Gaussian. In this section we discuss how well CMB-S4, given a detection, could characterize the shape of the B-mode spectrum, test for significant higher-order correlations involving tensor modes, and test for parity violation. These additional features would demonstrate the degree to which the data supports the expectation from the simplest inflationary models, or whether there is evidence for richer (or non-inflationary) physics. 

\subsection{The shape of the tensor power spectrum}
The vast majority of inflation scenarios predict a red spectrum for gravitational waves, and in the simplest cases the canonical single-field consistency relation fixes $n_{\rm t}=-r/8$. For a single field with a sound speed less than one, or multiple fields, $n_{\rm t}/r<-1/8$ instead \cite{Price:2014ufa}. Allowing the inflaton to couple to higher curvature terms can produce a blue tilt \cite{Baumann:2015xxa}, but in general a very blue tensor spectral index is only possible in alternatives to inflation (see Section~\ref{subsec:alternatives}). 

Figure~\ref{fig:rnT} shows the projected contours in the $r$--$n_{\rm t}$ plane for CMB-S4, for fiducial values of $r=0.1$ or $r=0.01$. A test of the canonical single-field consistency relation $n_{\rm t}=-r/8$ is unfortunately out of reach. However, a significant bump in the spectrum, as would be produced if a non-vacuum source of gravitational waves dominates the signal \cite{Namba:2015gja} (see Section \ref{subsec:nonvac} for details) would be detectable. 

An upper limit or detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background from CMB-S4 would, on its own, provide only limited information on the overall shape of its spectrum. However, CMB-S4 combined with direct detection techniques such as pulsar timing and laser interferometry can place limits on the spectral tilt, $n_t$. Recent analysis shows the complementarity between observations over a wide range of frequencies in constraining the shape of the spectrum \cite{Lasky:2015lej,Meerburg:2015zua}. If indirect CMB limits to the high-frequency part of the spectrum are included (coming from its behavior as an additional source of radiation energy density \cite{Smith:2006nka}) the constraints become even tighter. For example, current upper limits to $n_t$ (at 95\% CL) using the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, LIGO, and indirect constraints which place an upper limit on the number of effective radiative degrees of freedom, $N_{\rm eff}-3.046 < 0.31$ \cite{Pagano:2015hma}, are given as a function of $r$ by \cite{Lasky:2015lej}
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm t} < -0.04 \log_{10} \left(\frac{r}{0.11}\right) + 0.36.
\end{equation}
A measurement of $r$ from CMB-S4, along with these other probes of the stochastic gravitational wave background, would allow us to place a firm upper limit to $n_t$.  Constraints to the amount of dark radiation from CMB-S4 will further improve the upper limit to $n_t$, with the improvement scaling approximately linearly with the CMB-S4 constraint to $N_{\rm eff}-3.046$ \cite{Meerburg:2015zua} (see Section~\ref{sec:constraintsntNeff}).

\subsection{Probing matter and gravitational interactions at the inflationary scale}\label{subsubsec:Interactions}
\label{subsec:sst}

Information about the spectrum of interacting particles relevant during inflation is contained in correlations beyond the power spectrum. Correlators including at least one B-mode will benefit significantly from the improved sensitivity of CMB-S4 and will probe the particles that contribute to sourcing primordial gravitational waves. In particular, the three point correlation $\langle \zeta(\mathbf{k}_1)\zeta(\mathbf{k}_2)\gamma_\sigma(\mathbf{k}_3) \rangle$ can be constrained using $\langle BTT\rangle$, $\langle BTE\rangle $ and $\langle BEE\rangle$.

The details of the tensor-scalar-scalar correlator are contained in the bispectrum $B_{\zeta\zeta\gamma_\sigma}(\mathbf{k}_1,\mathbf{k}_2,\mathbf{k}_3)$, defined by pulling out the appropriate polarization structure associated with the tensor mode:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bsst}
\qquad \langle \zeta(\mathbf{k}_1)\zeta(\mathbf{k}_2)\gamma_\sigma(\mathbf{k}_3) \rangle = (2\pi)^3 \delta(\mathbf{k}_1+\mathbf{k}_2+\mathbf{k}_3) B_{\zeta\zeta\gamma_\sigma}(k_1,k_2,k_3) e_{ij}(\mathbf{k}_3,\sigma)\hat{k}_1^i \hat{k}_2^j,
\end{equation}
where $e_{ij}(\mathbf{k},\sigma)$ is the transverse-traceless polarization tensor. The amplitude and momentum dependence of the bispectrum $B_{\zeta\zeta\gamma_\sigma}$ can be parametrized by \cite{Meerburg:2016ecv}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bzzg}
B_{\zeta\zeta\gamma_\sigma}(k_1,k_2,k_3)= 16 \pi^4 A_{\rm s}^2 \sqrt{r}f_\mathrm{NL}^{\zeta\zeta\gamma} F(k_1,k_2,k_3).
\end{equation} 
The function $F(k_1,k_2,k_3)$ is often referred to by its ``shape,'' indicating which triangle of momentum modes is most strongly coupled.  For example, the equilateral template most strongly couples equal wavelength modes. The ``local" template has significant coupling in squeezed triangles, where one mode is substantially longer wavelength than the other two ($k_1\ll k_2\sim k_3$). The simplest models of inflation produce non-Gaussianity of approximately equilateral shape with an amplitude $f^{\zeta \zeta\gamma }_{\rm NL} = \sqrt{r}/16$ \cite{Maldacena:2002vr,Maldacena:2011nz}. 

In Table~\ref{tab:fnl_forecast2} we show the results of forecasts for $\sqrt{r}f_{\rm NL}$ using local and equilateral templates for $F$ and the $\langle BTT\rangle$ correlation. We anticipate similar constraints for $\langle BTE\rangle $ and $\langle BEE\rangle$. The level of non-Gaussianity predicted by the simplest models of inflation is out of reach. A detection of this correlation would be an immediate indication of some deviation from the simple inflationary paradigm \cite{Bordin:2016ruc,Dimastrogiovanni:2015pla}. There are a few known possibilities that would generate a scalar-scalar-tensor bispectrum with larger amplitude and/or different shape: different symmetry patterns (e.g. solid inflation \cite{Endlich:2012pz} or gauge-flation \cite{Maleknejad:2011jw, Adshead:2016iix}); GWs not produced as vacuum fluctuations; or multiple tensors (e.g.\ bigravity) \cite{Bordin:2016ruc}. Any non-zero tensor amplitude could also be sourced by a higher-order massive spin field that couples to two scalars and one graviton. See for example \cite{Hayden:2016xxa} for a very recent discussion of such signatures. A detection would therefore constitute a clear signature of new physics.

%We consider two scenarios, one in which the B-modes are noise dominated and one in which they are cosmic variance limited by a future detection of $r$. For a local shape primordial bispectrum the error decreases as you decrease the beam. The signal is dominated by large angle B-modes correlated with small angle $T$ modes as was pointed out in \cite{Meerburg:2016ecv}. An equilateral component from the $\langle BTT\rangle$ correlation function suffers from the decaying tensor modes, which are negligible for $\ell_B > 500$. After this, no equilateral triangles can be constructed and the error saturates. The effect is that equilateral type non-Gaussianities are almost insensitive to beam size. 
%
%On the right we show what happens when $B$ gets a primordial component. Only if $r < 0.001$  CMB-S4 noise dominates cosmic variance. We compare the potential constraining power of {\it Planck\/} to that of CMB-S4 in Table~\ref{tab:fnl_forecast2}; as $r$ gets larger, the relative improvement decreases. 
%
%In addition we consider and experiment with fixed effort. We show the results in Fig.~\ref{fig_BTTlocalfixedeffort} and \ref{fig_BTTequilfixedeffort}. We find that $BTT$ is practically insensitive to $f_{\rm sky}$ as long as B-modes are noise dominated. For $r = 0.001$ and above a larger sky fraction helps constrain $\langle BTT \rangle$.

\subsection{Distinguishing vacuum fluctuations from other particle physics sources of B-modes}
\label{subsec:nonvac}
Although CMB-S4 constraints on the shape of the tensor spectrum and its Gaussianity cannot test the predictions of the simplest inflation models, they will be able to perform the very important function of distinguishing a primordial but non-vacuum dominant source of B-modes. In non-minimal models with additional sectors coupled to the inflaton, excitations and particle production associated with other fields during inflation can source additional primordial gravitational waves~\cite{Cook:2011hg,Senatore:2011sp,Barnaby:2012xt}. The new fields and interactions that generate additional tensor fluctuations also generically contribute to the scalar fluctuations, so the non-vacuum B-mode signal is significantly constrained by the observed scalar power spectrum and its high degree of Gaussianity \cite{Barnaby:2012xt,Meerburg:2012id,Ferreira:2014zia,Mirbabayi:2014jqa,Ozsoy:2014sba}. 

%It is a rather generic feature that scalar non-Gaussianity constraints are relevant for models that produce B-modes from a mechanism other than the inflationary amplification of vacuum fluctuations, so in Fig. XXX we present the expected constraints from CMB-S4 in the $r-f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}$ plane. (Scalar non-Gaussianity is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{subsec:scalarNG}.)

%The relationship between the scale of inflation and the tensor-to-scalar ratio (Eq.~\ref{eq:Vofr}) holds in the simplest models of inflation. In non-minimal models with additional sectors coupled to the inflaton, excitations and particle production associated with other fields during inflation can source additional primordial gravitational waves~\cite{Cook:2011hg,Senatore:2011sp,Barnaby:2012xt}. Whether such signals can be competitive with inflationary vacuum fluctuations -- and thus undermine the connection implied by Eq.~(\ref{eq:Vofr}) -- relies on whether proposed models can avoid existing constraints imposed by the observed scalar power spectrum and observational constraints on scalar non-Gaussianity while maintaining self-consistent inflationary dynamics \cite{Barnaby:2012xt,Meerburg:2012id,Ferreira:2014zia,Mirbabayi:2014jqa,Ozsoy:2014sba}. It has been found that in cases where additional sectors are directly coupled to the inflaton (with stronger than gravitational strength couplings) that it is not possible to avoid existing constraints from {\it Planck}, and even for gravitational strength couplings some models are in tension with the 2015 {\it Planck\/} data \cite{Ozsoy:2014sba,Mirbabayi:2014jqa}. 
%

%To evade constraints from scalar non-Gaussianity, a model should ensure that the dynamics generating $\chi$ are as decoupled as possible from the inflaton sector~\cite{Barnaby:2012xt} (that is, only gravitationally coupled) and can furthermore restrict particle production to large scales where non-Gaussian constraints are weakest. This suggests a scenario where secondary production of gravitational waves can be significant: $\chi$ is a gauge field (naturally massless) whose quanta are created by a parity violating interaction with a spectator field~\cite{Cook:2011hg,Barnaby:2012xt}, so that only modes with a definite handedness are produced \cite{Anber:2006xt}. The gauge fields in turn source gravity waves and scalar perturbations. Helicity conservation implies that gravitons of that same handedness are produced in much larger amounts than gravitons of the opposite handedness \cite{Sorbo:2011rz}, and than scalar modes \cite{Barnaby:2012xt}. Furthermore, the source field's potential can be tuned so that the production of $\chi$ quanta occurs only around the time the modes contributing to the multipoles relevant for the B-mode search leave the horizon \cite{Namba:2015gja}.

In cases where additional sectors are directly coupled to the inflaton (with stronger than gravitational-strength couplings) {\it Planck\/} satellite constraints do not allow for the secondary source signal to have an amplitude competitive with the vacuum signal \cite{Ozsoy:2014sba,Mirbabayi:2014jqa}. However, a model with a significant non-vacuum signal can be constructed if the inflationary sector is only gravitationally coupled to a hidden sector containing a light pseudo-scalar and a gauge field during inflation \cite{Barnaby:2012xt,Peloso:2016gqs}. Fluctuations of the light scalar excite fluctuations of the gauge field, which in turn leads to gravitational wave production. To evade constraints from scalar non-Gaussianity, the source field's potential must be adjusted so that the production of gauge field quanta occurs only around the time the modes (contributing to the multipoles relevant for the B-mode search) leave the horizon \cite{Namba:2015gja}. Then, at this expense of fine-tuning the scales on which production occurs, there exists a range of values for other parameters that can lead to a gravitational-wave signal competitive with the vacuum fluctuations while remaining consistent with existing {\it Planck\/} data \cite{Namba:2015gja,Peloso:2016gqs}. For example, the gravitational waves from gauge-field production could be measured at a level of $r=10^{-1}$ with a vacuum contribution of only $r=10^{-4}$. While in that case the determination of the scale of inflation is affected by less than an order of magnitude, adjusting the parameters of the scenario may allow for more dramatic modifications of the relationship between $r$ and the inflationary energy scale given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:Vofr}). 

When secondary production of this sort is large enough to dominate the signal, the predicted gravitational-wave spectrum differs significantly from that of the vacuum fluctuations in several ways. First, the production mechanism is not continuous (to avoid non-Gaussianity constraints) and so sources a B-mode spectrum that is far from scale-invariant. Second, the tensor spectrum is strongly non-Gaussian. Finally, the gravitational waves resulting from the gauge field come with a definite handedness \cite{Anber:2006xt,Sorbo:2011rz} so parity violating  correlations would be sourced ($\langle TB\rangle$) and the angular bispectrum of B-modes would be dominated by $\ell_1+\ell_2+\ell_3=$ even modes, which would vanish in any theory that respects parity. Of these, the deviation from a flat spectrum is likely to be detected at highest significance by CMB-S4 \cite{Namba:2015gja,Peloso:2016gqs}. 

{\it Through constraints on the shape of the tensor power spectrum, CMB-S4 will be able to distinguish a signal dominated by an inflationary, but non-vacuum, source of primordial gravitational waves.}

%Fig. XXX shows the expected constraint on non-Gaussianity in the tensor sector. Fig. XXX shows constrains on parity violation. The predictions from the secondary source model are shown on the figures, and we see that this example is clearly distinguished if the non-vacuum contribution is so large that $r$ is not a good indicator of the scale of inflation.

Tests for parity violation and the shape of the spectrum are also of broader interest for inflation models whose particle content departs from the minimal scalar field for reasons other than specifically generating non-vacuum gravitational waves. In particular, scenarios in which non-Abelian gauge fields play a significant role in sourcing inflation are closely to the models discussed above. In chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation scenarios \cite{Maleknejad:2011jw,Adshead:2012kp,Adshead:2012qe,Adshead:2013qp,Adshead:2013nka,Dimastrogiovanni:2012st,Dimastrogiovanni:2012ew}, the central ingredient is a homogeneous and isotropic, flavor-space-locked gauge field that helps slow the roll of the inflaton or else is the inflaton itself. For a non-Abelian field with SU(2) symmetry, this means that the three flavor gauge vector potentials are mutually orthogonal in space. The stress-energy of this configuration could leave a unique imprint on a spectrum of primordial gravitational waves, which would be transferred to the B-mode spectrum in the CMB. The non-Abelian nature of the field introduces a preferred handedness onto this medium, leading to an enhancement of left (or right) circularly polarized gravitational waves. Again this would lead to parity-violating EB and TB correlations~\cite{Lue:1998mq,Gluscevic:2010vv} or parity violating higher $n$-point functions. If this process takes place in the post-inflationary environment, the gauge field could further impress a periodic modulation on the gravitational wave spectrum \cite{Bielefeld:2014nza,Bielefeld:2015daa}. Although the basic chromo-natural and gauge-flation models have been ruled out \cite{Namba:2013kia}, these unique features are expected to be generic to any viable variation on these scenarios and would be constrained by CMB-S4. Finally, it is worth noting that, if primordial gravitational waves were indeed chiral, they may present themselves first through a non-vanishing cross-correlation of B-modes with temperature, as demonstrated in Ref.~\cite{Contaldi:2008yz}. As parity violation is difficult to detect at high significance for these scenarios, but is also interesting for post-inflationary physics, forecasts for CMB-S4 can be found in the discussion of cosmic birefringence in Chapter 6.

Post-inflationary phase transitions themselves have also been proposed as a source of nearly scale-invariant gravitational waves detectable through CMB polarization (and direct detection) \cite{Krauss:1991qu,JonesSmith:2007ne,Giblin:2011yh,Figueroa:2012kw,Fenu:2013tea}. Even for a spectrum that matches the inflationary result on small scales, any such signal can in principle be distinguished from the inflationary expectation by the absence of super-horizon correlations at the time of recombination. A framework to extract specifically this part of the signal was proposed in Ref.~\cite{Baumann:2009mq} and could be applied to robustly extract the component of any signal that must come from physics outside of the hot big bang paradigm. Existing forecasts in the literature \cite{Lee:2014cya} indicate that a ground-based survey alone will not be able to detect super-horizon correlations at high significance if $r$ is much below $0.1$. But, if CMB-S4 does make a detection, this physics could be in reach of an eventual satellite mission.

% {\bf This seems to be a really important problem for interpretation of B-modes, as observed by S4, as due to vacuum fluctuations. How should this problem be handled? Do we highlight this in the introduction to this chapter? Do we get it into Chapter 1 as well?}


\subsection{Constraining alternatives to inflation}
\label{subsec:alternatives}
%A primordial contracting phase could also have put the largest scales we see today in causal contact. In the ekpyrotic scenario the scale factor $a$ is nearly constant while the magnitude of the Hubble parameter increases exponentially. In this case, the spectrum of tensor vacuum fluctuations produced during the contracting phase will be very blue \cite{Khoury:2001wf}. In addition the Hubble parameter at the end of the contracting phase can be approximately bounded (minimally, $H<M_{\rm P}$, or $H\sim T_{\rm reheat}$) and so the value of $H$ that sets the amplitude of tensor fluctuations on scales accessible through the CMB must be exponentially smaller. The vacuum fluctuations in a contracting universe are then far too small to be detected \cite{Boyle:2003km}. A matter-dominated contracting phase has also been proposed as an alternative to inflation \cite{Brandenberger:2012zb,Cai:2014jla,deHaro:2015wda}, but currently cannot be made to produce significant gravitational waves while also satisfying constraints on scalar non-Gaussianity \cite{Quintin:2015rta}. It is not yet clear if an observable amplitude of non-vacuum primordial gravitational waves could be sourced during contracting phase, but see \cite{Ben-Dayan:2016iks} for some recent work in that direction. \\

Vacuum fluctuations during inflation provide a simple, elegant, and compelling mechanism to create the initial seeds required for structure formation. 
One of inflation's most robust predictions is an adiabatic, nearly
scale-invariant spectrum of scalar density perturbations.
This prediction is in excellent agreement with observations, especially
considering the need to account for a small deviation from exact scale
invariance.  However, it is disputable whether these observations can be
considered a proof that inflation actually occurred (as has been discussed
since inflation was first proposed).
Clearly, a fair evaluation of the status of inflation requires the
consideration of competing theories and the hope to find experimental distinctions between inflation and these alternatives.

Leading alternatives to inflation can be classified into two primary categories based on the 
way in which they account for the observed causality of the scalar density fluctuations.
``Bouncing cosmologies'' rely on an initially cold, large universe and a subsequent phase of
slow contraction. This is then followed by a bounce that leads
to an expanding and decelerating FRW cosmology.  The most well studied examples are provided by 
``ekpyrotic'' or cyclic models \cite{Khoury:2001bz,Khoury:2001wf}
and more recently ``matter bounce'' models \cite{Brandenberger:2012zb,Cai:2014jla,deHaro:2015wda}.
The second class of alternatives to inflation arises from models that invoke a loitering phase of the cosmic expansion prior to the hot big bang -- with 
string gas cosmology \cite{Brandenberger:1988aj,Tseytlin:1991xk,Battefeld:2005av} providing an example. 

A detailed critique of these alternatives and their relevance to the science case for a
near-term CMB-based mission was presented in Appendix B of the ``CMBPol
Mission Concept Study'' \cite{Baumann:2008aq}.  
Since that publication, these alternative approaches to inflation have received considerable attention;
however, as science drivers for the CMB-S4 mission there are two important points to re-emphasize.
\begin{enumerate}
\item These alternatives invoke novel and incompletely understood physics to solve the problems associated with standard big bang cosmology.  This implies important theoretical challenges that have to be addressed carefully before the models mature into compelling alternatives to inflation.

\item Most or all of the alternatives to inflationary cosmology predict negligible tensors on CMB scales.
This strengthens the case for considering B-modes as a ``smoking gun'' of inflation.  It should be considered an important
opportunity to use CMB observations to constrain all known alternatives to inflation.
\end{enumerate}

One property that is shared by many (if not all) alternatives to inflation is that they require a violation of the Null Energy Condition (NEC). 
Such a violation typically implies the existence of catastrophic instabilities and/or fine-tuning of initial conditions.
This presents an important challenge for alternatives to inflation, but it does not imply that alternatives are impossible to realize. 
An example of a stable bounce violating the NEC was put forward in Ref.~\cite{Creminelli:2006xe} and then used in the ``new ekpyrotic'' scenario in Refs.~\cite{Buchbinder:2007ad,Creminelli:2007aq}. Although this model is consistent at the level of effective field theory, it is not clear whether it is possible to find a UV completion for it. 
This is a very important issue because the quantization of the new ekpyrotic theory, prior to the introduction of a UV cutoff and a UV completion, leads to a catastrophic vacuum instability \cite{Kallosh:2007ad}.  Similar challenges arise in models like string gas cosmology where NEC violation is required to exit the loitering phase to a radiation-dominated universe
\cite{Brustein:1994kw,Kaloper:1995ey,Kaloper:1995tu,Kaloper:2007pw}.  Whether such obstacles can be overcome is an area of ongoing research.

However, despite the theoretical challenges in understanding the background evolution, it has been argued that many 
of the observational predictions of such alternative models are independent of these issues.
Most notable is that all known alternative constructions seem to predict negligible tensor modes on large scales.
This was an early prediction of ekpyrotic models, and appears true as well for the more recently 
studied matter bounce models when constraints on scalar non-Gaussianity are also taken into consideration \cite{Quintin:2015rta}. It is not yet clear if an observable amplitude of non-vacuum primordial gravitational waves could be sourced during the contracting phase, but see Ref.~\cite{Ben-Dayan:2016iks} for some recent work in that direction.

{\it A detection of primordial gravitational waves with a spectrum consistent with vacuum fluctuations would rule out all currently proposed alternatives to inflation.}

\subsection{Constraints on the graviton mass}

Theories of massive gravity come in many flavors (see e.g.\ Refs.~\cite{Dubovsky:2004sg,Hinterbichler:2011tt}), and their predictions in the scalar sector differ significantly. However, by definition, the dispersion relation for the graviton in all of them is
\begin{equation}
\omega^2=p^2+m_g^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the physical momentum and $m_g$ the possibly time-dependent graviton mass. As a consequence, gravitational waves necessarily have frequencies $\omega>m_g$. A detection of primordial $B$-mode polarization on angular degree scales may be considered as a detection of gravitational waves with frequencies $\omega\sim H_{\rm rec}$ through the quadrupole they produce in the primordial plasma, where $H_{\rm rec}\simeq 3\times 10^{-29}$~eV is the Hubble parameter at recombination. A detection then implies a model-independent bound $m_g<H_{\rm rec}$ or 
\begin{equation}
m_g< 3\times 10^{-29}{\mbox{ eV}}\,.
\end{equation}
If the graviton mass is time-dependent, this should be interpreted as a constraint on its mass around the time of recombination.

Because the perturbations in the primordial plasma before and around recombination are linear, the effect of the graviton mass is straightforward to incorporate by a simple modification of the field equation for tensor metric perturbations so that the above argument can be made more quantitative. The equation of motion for the transverse-traceless metric perturbation $\gamma$ takes the same form as for a minimally coupled massive scalar field
\begin{equation}
\label{massive}
\ddot{\gamma}_k(t)+3{\dot a\over a} \dot{\gamma}_k(t)+\left(m_g^2+\left(\frac{k}{a}\right)^2\right) \gamma_k(t)=0\,.
\end{equation}
Here $k$ is the comoving momentum of the metric perturbation, and the background cosmological metric is
\begin{equation}
ds^2= -dt^2+a^2(t)d{\bf x}^2\,.
\end{equation}
The consequences of this modification are discussed in detail in Ref.~\cite{Dubovsky:2009xk}. The most important consequence is that superhorizon modes start to oscillate around the time $t_m$ when $H(t_m)=m_g$, and their amplitude subsequently redshifts as $a^{-3/2}$. In contrast, in the massless case all modes remain frozen until they enter the horizon. This results in a suppression of the amplitude of primordial B-modes for $m_g\gg H_{\rm rec}$, and a detection of B-modes would rule out this possibility. For masses around $H_{\rm rec}$, there is no suppression, but the angular power spectra are modified by the presence of a graviton mass, and a detection of primordial $B$-mode polarization would allow a measurement of the graviton mass. 
%The next part is repetition
%A detection of primordial gravitational waves with an angular $B$-mode power spectrum consistent with that expected in general relativity would imply $m_g< 3\times 10^{-29}{\mbox{ eV}}$.
 
Weak lensing currently constrains the mass of the graviton to be $m_g<6\times 10^{-32}\,eV$. This bound assumes that the dispersion relation of the scalar modes is modified. The limits discussed here are weaker but have the advantage that they are model-independent and directly constrain tensor modes. For comparison, the current model-independent bounds on the graviton mass arise from the indirect detection of $\sim 3\times 10^{-5}$~Hz gravitational waves through the timing of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar~\cite{Finn:2001qi}, and the bound on the difference in arrival times for gravitational waves with different frequencies in the recent direct detection of astrophysical gravitational waves with LIGO~\cite{Abbott:2016blz}. The resulting bounds are $m_g\lesssim 10^{-19}{\mbox{ eV}}$ and $m_g\lesssim 10^{-22}{\mbox{ eV}}$, respectively.  

{\it A detection of $B$-mode polarization consistent with expectations in the context of general relativity would improve current model-independent bounds on the mass of the graviton by more than six orders of magnitude.} 

We note that this improvement is calculated assuming measurements of the degree-angular-scale B-modes only. Measurements of $B$-mode polarization on the largest angular scales would further strengthen the bound. 



\section{Improved constraints on primordial density perturbations}
\label{sec:scalar}
%CMB-S4 will either detect primordial gravitational waves or improve current constraints on the amplitude of their power spectrum by almost two orders of magnitude. In addition, CMB-S4 will significantly improve our knowledge of the statistical properties of primordial density perturbations. 
All current data are consistent with primordial density perturbations that are adiabatic, Gaussian, and nearly scale-invariant. With its sensitivity and angular resolution, CMB-S4 will significantly improve current constraints on the scale dependence of the primordial power spectrum of scalar perturbations, on departures from Gaussianity, and on departures from adiabaticty. In fact, it will measure anisotropies in both the temperature and E-mode polarization of the CMB to cosmic variance over the entire range of multipoles that is not contaminated by foregrounds. As a consequence, it will place the strongest constraints achievable by any ground-based CMB experiment on observables that benefit from the number of modes measured, such as the primordial power spectrum and higher-order correlations.

\subsection{The scalar power spectrum}
%{\it The scalar spectral index}\\
The density perturbations are close to scale-invariant but not exactly so. In the context of $\Lambda$CDM, {\it Planck\/} has measured the scalar spectral index to be $n_{\rm s}=0.9677\pm0.0060$ and has established $n_{\rm s}-1<0$ at more than $5\,\sigma$. Realistic configurations of CMB-S4 will roughly decrease the uncertainty on the spectral index by a factor 2. To be specific, assuming a configuration without a site in the northern hemisphere, so that $40\%$ of the sky can be used after masking, a white noise level of $1\,\mu$K-arcmin in temperature and a modest angular resolution of $3$ arcmin, CMB-S4 will improve current constraints to $\sigma(n_{\rm s})=0.0028$. A configuration that includes a site in the northern hemisphere so that $60\%$ of the sky could be retained after masking the same noise levels and angular would further improve the constraints to $\sigma(n_{\rm s})=0.0023$. These improvements will provide valuable constraints on the space of inflationary models. 

%{\it Running of the scalar spectral index}\\
As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:upperLimits}, a measurement of the running of the scalar spectral index with a precision of a few parts in ten thousand would allow a measurement of $p$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:nsassump}), or equivalently $\mathcal{N}_\ast$. Such precision cannot be achieved with CMB-S4. For typical configurations of CMB-S4 the constraints on the running would improve to $\sigma(n_{\rm run})=0.002-0.003$. This will test the idea that the lack of power on large angular scales might be explained by scale dependence of the spectral index~\cite{Meerburg:2014bpa}.  

%{\it Oscillations in the primordial power spectrum}\\
Models of inflation that achieve super-Planckian inflaton displacements from repeated circuits of a sub-Planckian fundamental period may give rise to oscillatory features in the spectrum of primordial perturbations. The features may arise either from instanton effects or from periodic bursts of particle or string production. A search for such features is well motivated, even though the amplitude is model dependent and may be undetectably small. A detection would provide clues about the microscopic origin of the inflaton, while the absence of a detection can constrain the parameter space of these models in interesting ways. Again assuming a configuration with sites only in the southern hemisphere with a noise level of $1\,\mu$K-arcmin and an angular resolutions between $1$ and $3$ arcmin, CMB-S4 would tighten the constraints on the amplitude of features in the primordial power spectrum by a factor of about 2.

%RF Edited out because we currently do not think CMB-S4 will measure these scales.
%Primordial features should also have a signature in the CMB E-mode polarization. Moreover, they present a higher significance than that coming from temperature alone \cite{Dvorkin:2007jp}. In particular, the CMB E-mode polarization signature from an model with a step in the inflationary potential that maximizes the likelihood of the oscillatory features seen in the temperature power spectrum at multipoles of $\ell= 20-40$, should have the power of confirming or ruling out their primordial origin at the $\sim 3\sigma$ significance with nominal Planck polarization sensitivity \cite{Mortonson:2009qv,Dvorkin:2011ui,Miranda:2014fwa}, and at an even higher significance with CMB-S4.

Other physical effects during inflation could lead to weak structure in the observed power spectrum, e.g. by changing the equation of state during inflation \cite{Achucarro:2014msa}. Because of the stringent constraints on the minimum number of e-folds, such modifications cannot last very long and associated features only affect a small range of scales. It is therefore unlikely that CMB-S4 will significantly improve constraints on these type of features unless they are on very small scales. 



\subsection{Higher-order correlations of scalar modes}
\label{subsec:scalarNG}
Higher-order correlations of the scalar modes contain detailed information about the interacting matter Lagrangian during inflation. Because there are many inflation models that produce non-Gaussianity in the scalar sector with amplitude large enough to have been constrained with the {\it WMAP\/} and {\it Planck\/} satellites, the model space that will be tested is much larger than that for the tensor non-Gaussianity discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:sst}. The correlator of three scalar modes can be described by the bispectrum, $B_{\zeta}(\mathbf{k}_1,\mathbf{k}_2,\mathbf{k}_3)$, defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bsss}
\langle\zeta(\mathbf{k}_1)\zeta(\mathbf{k}_2)\zeta(\mathbf{k}_3)\rangle=(2\pi)^3\delta(\mathbf{k}_1+\mathbf{k}_2+\mathbf{k}_3)B_{\zeta}(\mathbf{k}_1,\mathbf{k}_2,\mathbf{k}_3)\,.
\end{equation}
The structure of particle interactions relevant for inflation provides both a general organizing principle for this functional space and several specific, well motivated forms of the bispectrum that can be explicitly compared to data. Here we briefly review the classification of scalar non-Gaussianity from inflation and then present forecasts for improvements from CMB-S4 on a few of the standard bispectral templates. We also comment on non-Gaussian signatures that are especially relevant for large-field inflation.

The space of non-Gaussian signals from inflation can be grouped into two conceptual categories that also generate distinguishable features in the correlation functions. These are signals that: (1) indicate non-trivial self-interactions of the effective inflaton fluctuation; or (2) indicate fluctuations in degrees of freedom other than the inflaton. 

All bispectra that come from fluctuations of the field that drives inflation (``single-clock'' scenarios) most strongly couple Fourier modes of similar wavelengths. The ``squeezed limit'' of these bispectra (the coupling of modes $k_1\ll k_2\sim k_3$) is very restricted. A large fraction of the parameter space for these scenarios is captured by two templates for the bispectrum, the so-called equilateral and orthogonal shapes.  Equilateral~\cite{Babich:2004gb} and orthogonal shapes~\cite{Senatore:2009gt} arise in a wide variety of scenarios involving interaction during inflation that respect the underlying shift symmetry (i.e.\ are approximately scale-invariant).  This may include scenarios where inflaton fluctuations have non-trivial self-interactions~\cite{Silverstein:2003hf,ArkaniHamed:2003uz,Alishahiha:2004eh,Chen:2006nt,Cheung:2007st,Senatore:2009gt} or couplings between the inflaton and other (potentially massive) degrees of freedom~\cite{Chen:2009zp,Tolley:2009fg, Cremonini:2010ua, Achucarro:2010da,Baumann:2011nk,Barnaby:2011pe,Arkani-Hamed:2015bza}.  While many of these models lead to different shapes in detail, the signal-to-noise ratio is typically dominated by equilateral configurations.  One of the important features of these shapes is that single-field slow-roll inflation necessarily produces $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil} < 1$~\cite{Creminelli:2003iq} and therefore any detection of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil} \geq 1$ would rule out this very wide class of popular models.  Furthermore, a detection would imply that inflation is a strongly coupled phenomenon and/or involved more than one field~\cite{Baumann:2014cja,Alvarez:2014vva,Baumann:2015nta}.  These possibilities could be distinguished, in principle, with further observations.  Current constraints on the equilateral and orthogonal shapes are $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil} = -4 \pm 43$ and $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm ortho} = -26 \pm 21$, both (68\% CL)~\cite{Ade:2015ava}. In single-field inflation, the amplitude of the non-Gaussianity typically suggests a new energy scale, $M_{\rm s}$, such that $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil} \propto A_{\rm s}^{-1/2} \, (H/M_{c_{\rm s}})^2$~\cite{Cheung:2007st,Baumann:2011su}; this energy scale is where self-interactions become strongly coupled and current limits translate into $M_{c_{\rm s}}>\mathcal{O}(10)H$.  In the presence of additional hidden sectors, the amplitude of non-Gaussanity scales with the strength of the coupling between the inflaton and these additional fields, usually suppressed by an energy scale $\Lambda$.  Current limits give $\Lambda  > (10{-}10^{5}) H$~\cite{Green:2013rd,Assassi:2013gxa}, with the variation depending mostly on the dimension of the operator coupling the two sectors.  For $r > 0.01$, these constraints require some of the interactions to be weaker than gravitational.  The improvements from CMB-S4 would further tighten existing constraints on a wide variety of interactions of the inflaton with itself and any other fields that are excited during inflation.    

When light degrees of freedom other than the inflaton contribute to the observed scalar fluctuations, a much wider degree of coupling between modes of very different wavelengths is allowed. Historically, the most well-studied template of this type comes from the ``local'' model, which couples short wavelength modes $k_2\sim k_3$ with equal strength to all long wavelength modes $k_1$. A detection of this shape (and any non-trivial squeezed limit coupling more generally) would rule out all models of single-clock inflation \cite{Creminelli:2004yq}. In addition, such a signal would open the door to significant cosmic variance on all scales from coupling of fluctuations within our observed volume to any super-Hubble modes \cite{Nelson:2012sb,LoVerde:2013xka,Nurmi:2013xv}. Indeed, there would be room for a significant shift between the observed amplitude of scalar fluctuations (and so the observed $r$) and the mean value of fluctuations on much larger scales \cite{Bonga:2015urq}. Any scenario that predicts local non-Gaussianity together with fluctuations on scales much larger than our observed volume predicts a probability distribution for our observed $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$, but many well-motivated scenarios also predict a small mean value; these include the simplest modulated reheating scenario \cite{Zaldarriaga:2003my} and ekpyrotic cosmology \cite{Lehners:2009ja}, both of which predict mean values of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}\sim5$. 
Currently the strongest constraints on the local shape come from the {\it Planck\/} 2015 temperature and polarization analysis that finds $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local} = 0.8 \pm 5.0$~\cite{Ade:2015ava}. A noise-free cosmic-variance-limited CMB experiment is expected to produce constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$ with 1$\,\sigma$ error bars of about 3 \cite{Komatsu:2001rj}. Conservatively assuming a configuration without a site in the northern hemisphere, leaving around $40\%$ of the sky unmasked, and assuming a white noise level of $1\,\mu$K-arcmin in temperature and an angular resolution of $1$ arcmin, the improvement expected of CMB-S4 over current limits is slightly less than a factor of 2. This is not sufficient to reach the interesting theoretical threshold around $|f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}|\lesssim 1$~\cite{Alvarez:2014vva}, but will still reduce the space of viable models or hint at a detection. CMB-S4 could, for example, provide hints for the mean level of non-Gaussianity expected from modulated reheating scenario or ekpyrotic cosmology at roughly the $2\,\sigma$ level. The simplest curvaton scenario, which predicts $f_{\rm NL} = -5/4$ \cite{Lyth:2001nq}, will unfortunately be out of reach. Large-scale structure surveys (e.g.\ \cite{Dore:2014cca}) may eventually achieve constraints $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$; those observations of the inhomogeneities in the late Universe would be very complementary to the results of CMB-S4.

Right: Sensitivity of local type non-Gaussianities as a function of the minimum multipole. The local type non-Gaussianity benefits from having the lowest multipoles, while the other standard shapes saturate to a constant at low $\ell_{\rm min}$ (not shown, see Table~\ref{tab:fnl_forecast}).

Table~\ref{tab:fnl_forecast} shows the forecasted constraints on the local, equilateral, orthogonal, and enfolded shapes from CMB-S4. Our convention for extracting a normalization of the amplitude, $f_{\rm NL}$, follows \cite{Babich:2004gb} and \cite{Ade:2013ydc}, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
B_{\zeta}(k_1,k_2,k_3) = \frac{3}{5} (4 \pi^4) 2 A_{\rm s}^2 f_{\rm NL} F(k_1,k_2,k_3) ,
%\frac{3}{5} (4 \pi^4) B_{\Phi} (k_1,k_2,k_3) = 
\end{equation}
with e.g. 
\begin{equation}
F^{\rm local}(k_1,k_2,k_3) = \frac{1}{k_1^{4-n_{\rm s}}k_2^{4-n_{\rm s}}} + {\rm 2\;perms.}
\end{equation}
%\footnote{Note that there is a factor of $5/3$ in relating the gauge-invariant Newtonian potential $\Phi$ to the curvature $\zeta$ \cite{Maldacena:2002vr}.}
%In Fig.~\ref{fig_fnlforecast} we show the constraints as a function of the maximum multipole on the left using the following configuration $f_{\rm sky} = 0.4$, $T$-noise = 1$\,\mu$K-arcmin and $E$-noise = $\sqrt{2}$ $\mu$K-arcmin and a beam of $1^\prime$ and $\ell_{\rm min} = 30$.
Local type non-Gaussianities benefit from large scales, and as much as $40\%$ of the signal is lost if the modes $\ell<30$ are not available. 
%as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig_fnlforecast} on the right. 
Ideally, large-scale information from {\it Planck\/} \cite{Ade:2015ava} should be included to place the best constraints on local non-Gaussianities. Including {\it Planck\/} low-$\ell$ modes (using $f_{\rm sky} = 0.75$ \cite{Ade:2015ava} to determine the noise level, and $f_{\rm sky}=0.4$ for the maximal overlap) we can improve the forecasted bounds on local type non-Gaussianities by almost  factor of 2.5. Equilateral, enfolded and orthogonal non-Gaussianities are not affected by excluding the lowest multipoles. Note that our forecast, using Planck Blue Book\cite{Planck:2006aa}
%\footnote{\url{http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA/PLANCK/docs/Bluebook-ESA-SCI(2005)1_V2.pdf}}
values, deviate slightly from the actual bounds on non-Gaussianities obtained in Ref.~\cite{Ade:2015ava}. The expected factor of improvement over {\it Planck}-only is somewhere between 2.4 and 2.7 for all shapes considered. Information saturates beyond $\ell_{\rm max} = 4000$ for all shapes for an experiment with a $1^\prime$ beam.

  \label{tab:fnl_forecast}
\end{table*}

Perhaps of special interest for CMB-S4 are non-Gaussian signatures that would be expected in models of large-field inflation. For example, in models in which the inflaton is an axion, there is only an approximate discrete shift symmetry. In that case instanton contributions to the potential and periodic bursts of particle or string production naturally lead to periodic features in the bispectrum. If moduli in the underlying string constructions do not evolve appreciably, instanton contributions lead to oscillations with a constant amplitude in the logarithm of $k$. In general, moduli evolve during inflation and cause a drift in the frequency and a scale-dependent amplitude~\cite{Flauger:2014ana}. At present, these shapes have not yet been constrained systematically. Often these contributions will lead to counterparts in the power spectrum and are expected to be detected there first~\cite{Behbahani:2011it}, but this need not be the case~\cite{Behbahani:2012be}. A first attempt has been made~\cite{Ade:2015ava} to look for resonant and local features in the bispectrum, and a more dedicated analysis is underway. Since features in the power spectrum and the bispectrum generally contain correlated parameters \cite{Meerburg:2009ys,Achucarro:2010da, Flauger:2010ja,Meerburg:2015yka,Achucarro:2012fd,Palma:2014hra}, statistical methods have been developed to use constraints from both the power spectrum and the bispectrum to further limit the model space \cite{Fergusson:2014hya,Meerburg:2015owa}. Signatures of higher-order massive spin fields \cite{Arkani-Hamed:2015bza,Chen:2015lza} would also lead to a bispectrum with decaying features, which will not be present in the power spectrum.
%So a search for these more general shapes is well motivated. 

%Using both $T$ and $E$-mode polarization, CMB-S4 will improve constraints by about of two compared to {\it Planck\/} as we will show in the next section. Bispectra containing at least one B-mode, will generally be much better constrained (currently there is no bound on such correlation functions) and will benefit from CMB-S4.

%Next, we determine the improvements as function of a fixed effort with $f_{\rm sky} = 0.4$, corresponding to noise of 1$\,\mu$K-arcmin.  The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_TTTfixedeffort} as a function of $f_{\rm sky}$ for a $1^\prime$ beam. $\langle TTT \rangle$ generally benefits from large sky fraction, which is a result of the fact that most modes are already cosmic variance limited (and hence information is saturated and does not benefit from a deeper patch).

%{\color{blue} Any one care to work this out more:} 
%Higher-order statistics encode further information about particle content and interactions. The relative amplitude of certain limits on the trispectrum (the momentum space 4-point function) and of the trispectrum can also reveal whether there may be multiple sources contributing to the primordial fluctuations (and both may be different from the fluctuations of the inflaton). {\bf more...}


%In the modulated reheating scenario, the field which drives inflation $\phi$ decays to the particles of the standard model with a rate $\gamma$ which is determined by the value of a second field $\sigma$ which remains light throughout inflation. The quantum fluctuations in $\sigma$ result in a spatially modulated reheating surface resulting in the curvature perturbations that we observe in the CMB and large-scale structure. The process by which the fluctuations in the light field are converted into curvature fluctuations naturally results in local non-Gaussianity given by $f_{\rm NL} = 5(1-\Gamma \Gamma^{\prime\prime}/\Gamma^{\prime2})$, where this formula holds in the case that $\phi$ oscillates about a quadratic minimum after inflation and the fluctuations in $\phi$ make a negligible contribution to the observed power spectrum.

%This can be contrasted with the simplest curvaton scenario, where a scalar field $\sigma$ which remains light during inflation comes to dominate the energy density of the Universe after the field which drives inflation $\phi$ decays. The fluctuations in the energy density of $\sigma$ then determine the curvature perturbations that are observed today. The local non-Gaussianity in this simple model is predicted to be $f_{\rm NL} = -5/4$ \cite{Lyth:2001nq}, which is unfortunately a few times smaller than the expected error bar from CMB Stage-IV.

%In the absence of a detection, however, it is important to ask what can be learned from improved constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$. Though not firm, nor entirely robustly defined, it can be argued that a natural theoretical threshold where qualitatively new general conclusions about the physics of the early Universe can be drawn would come from constraints on $f_{\rm NL}<\mathcal{O}(1)$, see for example [1412.4671] for a detailed discussion. In order to achieve this level of constraint, it seems necessary to move beyond the cosmic microwave background to study other data sets, such as large-scale structure. Despite the fact that CMB Stage-IV is not expected to reach this threshold, it is worth asking what can be gleaned from an improved constraint on $f_{\rm NL}$ from the CMB.

\section{Spatial curvature}
\label{sec:curvature}

Despite the fact that inflation drives the spatial curvature to zero at the level of the background evolution, it predicts small, but non-zero curvature for a typical observer. The curvature measured in a Hubble patch receives contributions from long wavelength perturbations and is expected to be $|\Omega_k|\lesssim10^{-4}$. A measurements of $\Omega_k$ exceeding this expectation would contain important information about the process responsible for inflation. In particular, if $|\Omega_k|$ is found to be considerably larger than this value, it would tell us that the inflaton was not slowly rolling when scales slightly larger than our observable horizon exited the horizon. Furthermore, observations of large negative $\Omega_k$ would falsify eternal inflation, while observation of positive and large $\Omega_k$ would be consistent with false vacuum eternal inflation~\cite{Guth:2012ww,Kleban:2012ph}.

Current constraints on this parameter from the CMB alone are $\Omega_k= 0.005^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$ \cite{Ade:2015xua}. Including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data tightens the bound to $\Omega_k=0.000\pm0.005$. % CMB-S4 is expected to constrain spatial curvature at a level of $\sigma(\Omega_k)\simeq 10^{-3}$. A detection at this level would have profound implications for the inflationary paradigm. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:OmK_vs_FWHM_or_uK_arcmin} presents the $\Omega_k$ constraints achievable with CMB-S4 in isolation (solid orange) and in combination with {\it Planck\/} (dashed orange), future BAO measurements from DESI~\cite{Font-Ribera:2013rwa} (solid blue), and both (dashed blue). The constraining power of each configuration is explored as a function of CMB-S4's beam size (left panel) and polarization noise (right panel); the noise and beam are fixed to 1$\,\mu$K-arcmin and 3 arcmin in the left and right panels, respectively.
In the context of a 1-parameter extension of $\Lambda$CDM that includes curvature, the constraints on $\Omega_k$ only weakly dependend on the resolution and sensitivity for the range considered for CMB-S4. For sensitivities between $1$ and $3\,\mu K$-arcmin and a resolution between $1$ and $3$ arcmin, CMB-S4 together with low-$\ell$ Planck data will place $1\,\sigma$ limits of $4-5\times10^{-3}$.
% A Fisher forecast using~\cite{Errard:2015cxa} and suggests that CMB-S4 is able to place $1\,\sigma$ limits of $6.7\times10^{-3}$ on a fiducial value of zero curvature. This forecast does not include foregrounds, assumes a white noise level of 1$\,\mu$K-arcmin, 3 arcmin resolution, and a multipole range of $30\leq\ell\leq 4000$ measured over $40\%$ of the sky. The forecast assumes information from unlensed $TT$, $TE$ and $EE$ spectra along with CMB lensing information constructed with an iterative $EB$ quadratic estimator~\cite{Hirata:2002jy,Smith:2010gu}. Including {\it Planck\/} $TT$, $TE$ and $EE$ information over an additional $20\%$ of the sky with a multipole range of $30\leq\ell\leq 2500$ together with a prior on the optical depth $\tau=0.06\pm0.01$ reduces the uncertainty by a factor 2.{\bf ?} This demonstrates the importance of large-scale CMB polarization information in breaking degeneracies involving $\Omega_k$ (primarily with $\tau$)~\cite{Leonard:2016evk}. 
Adding the DESI measurements of the BAO standard ruler (at redshifts of 0 to 1.9) further reduces the uncertainty to a combined $1\,\sigma$ limit of around $7.1\times10^{-4}$. CMB-S4 is therefore unable to measure curvature levels typical of slow-roll eternal inflation and any detection of curvature by CMB-S4 would have profound implications for the inflationary paradigm.

\section{Isocurvature}
Measurements of CMB temperature/polarization power spectra indicate that the primordial initial conditions are adiabatic, that is, spatial entropy fluctuations vanish:
\begin{align}
S_{i \gamma}\equiv \frac{\delta n_{i}}{n_{i}}-\frac{\delta n_{\gamma}}{n_{\gamma}} =0.
\end{align}
Here the species label $i$ can denote baryons, cold dark matter (CDM), or neutrinos. Number densities are denoted by $n_{i}$ and perturbations in them by $\delta n_{i}$.

This can also be expressed in a gauge-invariant way for any two species $i,j$:
\begin{equation}
S_{ij}=3(\zeta_i-\zeta_j),
\end{equation}
where $\zeta_i = -\Psi - H \delta\rho_i/\dot{\rho}_i$.

Adiabatic perturbations are produced in models where the initial perturbations in all species are seeded by the inflaton. If fluctuations are also sourced by a second field, the initial conditions are a mixture of adiabatic and entropy (a.k.a isocurvature) perturbations, for which $S_{i\gamma}\neq 0$. These initial conditions determine the acoustic peak structure and large-scale amplitude of CMB anisotropies, as well as large-scale structure statistics \cite{Bond:1984fp,Kodama:1986fg,Kodama:1986ud,Hu:1994jd,Moodley:2004nz,Bean:2006qz}. Observations can thus probe the number of fields during inflation. 
\label{sec:isosec}
Each species can carry isocurvature perturbations in its density (e.g.\ Refs~\cite{Bucher:1999re,Bucher:2004an,Moodley:2004nz}).\footnote{Neutrinos can also carry velocity isocurvature, but this mode is not well motivated in inflationary models.} Indeed, the modes of the perturbation evolution equations correspond to adiabatic, CDM density isocurvature (CDI), baryon density isocurvature (BDI), neutrino density isocurvature (NDI), and neutrino velocity isocurvature (NVI) initial conditions.

%\end{figure} 

Data from {\it WMAP\/} \cite{Dunkley:2008ie}, \textit{Planck} \cite{Ade:2013uln,Ade:2015lrj}, and other experiments \cite{Enqvist:2000hp,MacTavish:2005yk} indicate that perturbations are predominantly adiabatic. The limits can be stated in terms of the fractional primordial power in each isocurvature mode:\begin{equation}
\beta\equiv \frac{P_{S_{i\gamma}}(k)}{P_{S_{i\gamma}}(k)+P_{\zeta\zeta}(k)}.
\end{equation}
%The current CMB limits (allowing one isocurvature mode at a time) are shown in Table~\ref{table:fisher_model_independent}, along with a forecast of CMB-S4 sensitivity.\footnote{All forecasts in this isocurvature section are produced using Fisher-matrix techniques.} In Table~\ref{table:fisher_model_independent}, ``correlated'' refers to totally correlated or anti-correlated (with $\zeta$) isocurvature perturbations and all results are quoted at a fiducial $k=0.05~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Limits to BDI perturbations are not separately listed, since at linear order they are indistinguishable from CDI perturbations \cite{Gordon:2002gv,Lewis:2002nc,Lewis:2007kz,Gordon:2009wx}. CMB-S4 could improve on these limits by a factor of 2--5, as shown in Table~\ref{table:fisher_model_independent}.

In this section we focus on two specific scenarios for isocurvature: the curvaton; and compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs). Disucssion of axion-type isocurvature is deferred to Section~\ref{axion_iso}.

The curvaton scenario is an alternative to single-field inflationary models in which a sub-dominant second field $\sigma$ acquires vacuum fluctuations during inflation, becomes more important later, sources $\zeta$, and then decays \cite{Mollerach:1989hu,Mukhanov:1990me,Moroi:2001ct,Lyth:2001nq,Lyth:2002my}. Curvaton candidates include sneutrinos, string moduli, and others \cite{Postma:2002et,Kasuya:2003va,Ikegami:2004ve,Mazumdar:2004qv,Allahverdi:2006dr,Papantonopoulos:2006xi,Mazumdar:2010sa,Mazumdar:2011xe}. Depending on whether a species $i$ (or its set of quantum numbers) is produced by, before, or after curvaton decay, perturbations in $i$ are offset from $\zeta$, leading to isocurvature perturbations \cite{Lyth:2001nq,Lyth:2002my,Gordon:2002gv}:

\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i \gamma}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}-3\zeta-3(\zeta_{\gamma}-\zeta),&\mbox{if $i$ is produced before $\sigma$ decay,}\\3\left(\frac{1}{r_{\rm D}}-1\right)\zeta-3(\zeta_{\gamma}-\zeta),&\mbox{if $i$ is produced by $\sigma$ decay},\\ -3(\zeta_\gamma-\zeta),&\mbox{if $i$ is produced after $\sigma$ decay},\end{array}\right.\label{eq:strew}.
\end{eqnarray} Here $\zeta_{i}$ is the density perturbation in $i$ on surfaces of constant curvature. The parameter $r_{\rm D}$ is the fractional energy density in the curvaton when it decays. 

The mixture of isocurvature modes is determined by whether or not baryon number, lepton number, and CDM are produced before, by, or after curvaton decay. Curvaton-type isocurvature is distinct from axion isocurvature, because it is correlated (or anti-correlated) with $\zeta$. If lepton number is produced by curvaton decay, the lepton chemical potential $\xi_{\rm lep}$ is important in setting the amplitude of NDI modes \cite{Lyth:2002my,Gordon:2003hw,DiValentino:2011sv}:
\begin{equation}
S_{\nu \gamma}=
-\frac{135}{7}\left(\frac{\xi_{\rm lep}}{\pi}\right)^2\zeta_{\gamma}.\end{equation}
There are $27$ distinct curvaton decay scenarios, since baryon number, lepton number, and CDM could each be produced before, by, or after curvaton decay. Viable models are those in which one of baryon number or CDM is produced by curvaton decay, and those in which \textit{both} baryon number and CDM are produced after curvaton decay. For curvaton-decay scenarios, we use the notation ($b_{x}$, $c_{y}$, $L_{z}$), where $x\in ({\rm before, by, after})$. Here $b$ denotes baryon number, $c$ denotes CDM, and $L$ denotes lepton number. For example, $(b_{\rm before}, c_{\rm by}, L_{\rm by})$ is a model in which baryon number is produced before curvaton decay, CDM by curvaton decay, and lepton number by curvaton decay.

Current isocurvature limits favor values of $r_{\rm D}\simeq 1$, except for models in which baryon number is produced by curvaton decay and CDM before (or vice versa), which favor central values of $r_{\rm D} \simeq 0.16$ ($r_{\rm D} \simeq 0.84$). 

The current limits \cite{Smith:2015bln} on $r_{\rm D}$ are shown in Table~\ref{limits_rd}, along with a forecast of CMB-S4's sensitivity to $r_{\rm D}$ via isocurvature modes. There is dramatic improvement in the $(b_{\rm by},c_{\rm before},L_{\rm by})$ and $(b_{\rm before},c_{\rm by},L_{\rm by})$ scenarios because of the accompanying NDI perturbations. One unusual case is the $(b_{\rm after},c_{\rm after}, L_{y_{\rm L}})$ scenario. Here the isocurvature component just constrains the degenerate combination \cite{Smith:2015bln} $\chi_{\rm D} \equiv \left\{1+\xi_{\rm lep}^2/(\pi^2) \left(1/r_D -1\right)\right\}^{-1}$, while the independent constraint to $\xi_{\rm lep}^{2}$ is driven by the CMB limit on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$).

Depending on the scenario, forecasting shows that the CMB-S4 sensitivity to curvaton-sourced isocurvature should improve on current limits by a factor of 2--4. In models with nearly-canceling CDM and baryon isocurvature perturbations, CMB-S4 limits to neutrino isocurvature drive an improvement in the sensitivity to the lepton asymmetry from $\Delta \xi_{\rm lep}^{2}\simeq 0.015$ to $\Delta \xi_{\rm lep}^{2}\simeq 0.003$. This dramatic improvement would make CMB limits comparably sensitive to BBN probes of $\xi_{\rm lep}^{2}$ (for this decay scenario).

If baryon number is produced by curvaton decay, but CDM is produced after (or vice versa), a relative large compensated isocurvature perturbation (CIP) is produced between the baryons and CDM, that is
\begin{equation}
S_{bc}=\frac{\delta n_{\rm b}}{n_{\rm b}}-\frac{\delta n_{\rm c}}{n_{\rm c}}\neq 0.
\end{equation} Curvaton-generated CIPs are proportional to $\zeta$, $S_{\rm bc}=A\zeta$, where $A\simeq 17$ [$A\simeq -3$] in the $(b_{\rm by}, c_{\rm before}, L_{\rm z})$ [$(b_{\rm before}, c_{\rm by}, L_{\rm z})$] scenario. For CIPs, the initial relative densities of baryons and CDM vary, but with no additional overall matter or radiation density fluctuation.

%\end{figure} 

CIPs are relatively unconstrained at the linear level of the CMB power spectrum (see Ref.~\cite{Munoz:2015fdv} for an exception), but would induce non-Gaussianities in the CMB \cite{Grin:2011nk,Grin:2011tf,Grin:2013uya,He:2015msa}. As with weak gravitational lensing \cite{Hu:2001kj}, the CIP field $\Delta(\hat{n})$ can be reconstructed using CMB data. We find that at CMB-S4 sensitivity \cite{He:2015msa}, the threshold for a $95\%$ CL detection is $A\simeq 10$, and so a CIP test of the $(b_{\rm by}, c_{\rm before}, L_{\rm z})$ scenario is within reach of CMB-S4. This is a significant improvement over \emph{Planck} sensitivity, which at $95\%$ CL is $A\simeq 43$. Uncorrelated CIPs are less  motivated theoretically. Updating the analysis of Ref.~\cite{He:2015msa} with current parameters \cite{Ade:2015lrj} and CMB-S4 specifications, we find that the sensitivity of CMB-S4 to a scale-invariant (SI) angular power spectrum of uncorrelated CIPs is $\Delta_{\rm cl}=0.003$ at the $95\%$ CL. Here $\Delta_{\rm cl}$ is the r.m.s. CIP amplitude on cluster scales. This is a significant improvement over the upper limit of $\Delta_{\rm cl}\leq 0.077$ from {\it WMAP\/} \cite{Grin:2013uya}, or the forecasted {\it Planck\/} \cite{Ade:2015lrj} (including polarization) sensitivity of $\Delta_{\rm cl}\leq 0.015$ \cite{He:2015msa}. 

A complementary constraint on uncorrelated CIPs can be derived from an independent search for their second-order effect on the CMB power spectrum \cite{Munoz:2015fdv}. With a CMB-S4 experiment, the power spectra would be sensitive to a CIP amplitude of $\Delta_{\rm cl} = 0.026$ at the 95\% CL, a factor of 3 better than the corresponding limit from the {\it Planck\/} analysis (see Ref.~\cite{Munoz:2015fdv}). 
%The CMB-S4 constraints on these models are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CIPs_kovetz}.


\section{Microwave Background Anomalies}

Several features have been observed in maps of CMB temperature at
relatively low $\ell$ or large angular scales.  Some of these
so-called ``anomalies'' have been seen in both {\it WMAP\/} and {\it Planck\/}
data, and there is little doubt that they are real features on the CMB sky;
however, there is much less agreement about their statistical significance,
largely because of the difficulty of assessing the effects of a posteriori
choice when determining the probability of such features
(see, e.g.\ Refs.~\cite{Bennett:2010jb,Ade:2015hxq} and \cite{Schwarz:2015cma} for
different views).  Nevertheless, there is
the potential for any one of these departures from statistical isotropy to
tell us about fundamental physics, for example about the beginning of inflation.
Hence it is extremely interesting to perform follow-up studies using modes
beyond those of CMB temperature.  Deep mapping of CMB E modes provides the most
promising way of further probing these anomalies.

Some of the identified features (such as the lack of power in $C_\ell^{TT}$
for $\ell\lesssim30$ or the apparent correlation in the first few multipoles)
cannot be probed by CMB-S4 because they only affect the very largest scales.
However, two specific anomalies {\it can\/} be explored by CMB-S4

\begin{itemize}
  \item a hemispherical asymmetry or dipolar modulation of the large-scale
  power
  \item the presence of a particularly large region of low temperature,
  the ``cold spot.''
\end{itemize}

The first appears to extend to $\ell_{\rm max}\simeq65$, while the second has
structure up to about $5^\circ$ in scale.  Hence an experiment designed to
measure the B-mode recombination bump (peaking at $\ell\simeq80$)
will probe relevant E modes, and do so
at such a high a level of sensitivity that the information will be limited
by sample variance alone.

For the asymmetry, the question will be whether there could be a modulation
of the polarized CMB sky, and whether it is over the same range of
multipoles.  If the origin is a modification of the inflationary power
spectrum in $k$ (e.g.\ Ref.~\cite{Gordon:2005ai}),
then there should in fact be a slightly different projection
into $\ell$ space, which could be explored.
For the cold spot, if it is simply a large fluctuation
on the last-scattering surface, then the correlated part of the E modes can
be predicted from the temperature profile, and one can test whether the prediction
is consistent with the measured E-mode map; i.e., one can see if the E-mode map, after subtraction
of the temperature-correlated part, is consistent with the expected level of temperature-uncorrelated E-mode fluctuations. Inconsistency would be evidence for a more interesting origin for the cold spot.

%A variety of ideas have been proposed to explain the anomalies, ranging from Solar system dust artifacts to anisotropic models of inflation (for a summary, see \cite{Copi:2016hhq}). Unfortunately, none of those ideas leads to a convincing explanation, as it is simply difficult to find models that explain the alignments of the largest primordial structures in the Universe while at the same time lowering the amplitude of large-angle temperature correlations (e.g. \cite{Gordon:2005ai}). 

\section{Cosmic Strings}

Multi-field inflationary scenarios that end with phase transitions \cite{Hindmarsh:1994re,Vilenkin:1981iu,Kofman:1995fi,Tkachev:1998dc,Jeannerot:1995yn,Jeannerot:2003qv,Rocher:2004my} and models of brane-inflation in string theory \cite{Sarangi:2002yt,Jones:2003da,Copeland:2003bj} generically predict some level of vector and tensor modes actively sourced by topological defects. In particular, either a breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry or the production of fundamental strings at the end of inflation can lead to ``cosmic strings'' whose B-mode spectrum is primarily generated by vector modes, peaks on small scales ($\ell\sim 600$--1000), and is more similar in shape to the E-to-B lensing signal than to the vacuum spectrum. CMB-S4 should be able to distinguish even a small contribution from such sources \cite{Urrestilla:2008jv}, but the precise bounds from non-detection are related to the precision with which the lensing signal can be removed. Estimates made in Refs.~\cite{Seljak:2006hi,Avgoustidis:2011ax} indicate that CMB-S4 should be able to improve the limit on cosmic string tension by at least an order of magnitude beyond the current bounds from the CMB ($G\mu\sim10^{-7}$ \cite{Ade:2013xla,Ade:2015ava,Ade:2015xua}) and may be competitive with direct detection limits from the stochastic gravitational wave background ($G\mu\sim10^{-11}$ or $10^{-8}$, depending on the model assumed for string loops \cite{Arzoumanian:2015liz}). In addition, the spectra of different types of defect have different shapes, and should be distinguishable \cite{Urrestilla:2007sf,Avgoustidis:2011ax}. Measuring the location of the main peak would provide valuable insights into fundamental physics. For example, in the case of cosmic superstrings the position of the peak of the B-mode spectrum constrains the value of the fundamental string coupling $g_s$ in string theory \cite{Avgoustidis:2011ax}.

\end{table}

Cosmic strings can at most contribute O(1\%) to the total CMB temperature anisotropy~\cite{Ade:2013xla,Lizarraga:2014xza,Lazanu:2014eya}, however, they can still generate observable B-modes. As shown in \cite{Moss:2014cra}, the bounds on cosmic strings obtained solely from the POLARBEAR \cite{Ade:2014afa} and { BICEP}2~\cite{Ade:2014xna} B-mode spectra are comparable to those from temperature spectra. 
Forecasts of the predicted constraints on cosmic strings using the StringFast code \cite{Foreman:2011uj}, based on the CMBACT simulations \cite{Pogosian:1999np} of a general string network, allows for the correlation length of the strings, the ``wiggliness'' (which controls the small-scale structure of the string network) and the string rms velocity. StringFast allows for fast computation of the relevant string spectra, and includes the contribution to the string spectrum from scalar, vector and tensor modes, which are most relevant for the string B-modes \cite{Foreman:2011uj}.

In keeping with the methodology of recent results, we compute the string spectrum with a value of the string tension ($G_\mu/c^2=1.97\times10^{-6}$) that allows strings to make up all the TT power at $\ell=10$, and then use the fraction of the spectrum at that multipole $f_{10}$ as the forecast parameter. $f_{10}$ scales with the string tension as $f_{10} \propto G_\mu^2.$ The Fisher projections for {\it Planck\/} around a fiducial model of $f_{10}=0.01$ are $f_{10}<0.032,$ which maps to $G_\mu/c^2 < 3.5\times 10^{-7}\, 95\%$~CL, is consistent with the {\it Planck\/} constraints on the AH-mimic spectra.
We assume a fidcual model for the ``wiggliness'' $\alpha_\mathrm{str}$, string velocity $v_\mathrm{str}$ and correlation length $\xi_\mathrm{str}$ of $1.05, 0.4$ and $0.35$ respectively, in keeping with the model assumed in \cite{Foreman:2011uj}. We consider models where only the string fraction is varied, and the additional model where the small-scale structure of the string network is varied. The constraints are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:string_forecast} for a baseline resolution of 1 arcminute. The error on the string fraction for a 2 arcminute beam is only degraded by a few percent relative to the nominal case. In addition, the constraints are not strongly improved with the addition of BAO data, or with a more improved measurement of $\tau$.


\section{Primordial Magnetic Fields}
\label{sec:PMF}
The origin of the microgauss ($\mu$G) strength magnetic fields in galaxies and galaxy clusters is one of the long-standing puzzles in astrophysics \cite{Durrer:2013pga}. It is challenging to explain such fields based solely on the dynamo mechanism, without there being some initial seed field. However, if magnetic fields were present in the early Universe, they would remain frozen in the cosmic plasma and collapse with the rest of the matter to form the galactic fields \cite{Grasso:2000wj}, or at least provide the seeds for the dynamo. A primordial magnetic field (PMF) could be produced in the aftermath of cosmic phase transitions \cite{Vachaspati:1991nm} or in specially designed inflationary scenarios \cite{Turner:1987bw,Ratra:1991bn}. Detecting their signatures in the CMB temperature and polarization would decisively prove their primordial origin. Aside from explaining the galactic fields, bounds on PMF have profound implications for our understanding of the early Universe.  They help constrain theories of inflation \cite{Bonvin:2011dt}, models of the QCD and electroweak phase transitions \cite{Caprini:2007xq}, and baryogenesis \cite{Vachaspati:2001nb}.

The PMF affects CMB in several ways. Magnetic stress-energy induces scalar, vector, and tensor mode perturbations in the metric, and the Lorentz force generates vorticity in the photon-baryon fluid \cite{Subramanian:1998fn,Mack:2001gc,Lewis:2004ef,Shaw:2009nf,Paoletti:2010rx}. Dissipation of PMF on small scales dumps energy into the plasma, which produces spectral distortions and affects the recombination history \cite{Kunze:2014eka}.  Finally, Faraday rotation (FR) of CMB polarization converts some of the $E$ modes into B-modes \cite{Kosowsky:2004zh,Pogosian:2011qv}.

A stochastic PMF has two potentially observable frequency-independent contributions to the $B$-mode spectrum \cite{Shaw:2009nf}. One comes from the passive, or uncompensated tensor mode, which is generated by the PMF before neutrino decoupling. For nearly scale-invariant PMF, the spectrum of this component is indistinguishable from the inflationary gravity wave signal, while the amplitude is proportional to $B^4_{1\rm{Mpc}} [\ln(a_\nu / a_{\rm{PMF}})]^2$ \cite{Lewis:2004ef}, where $B_{1\rm{Mpc}}$ is the PMF strength smoothed over one megaparsec, $a_\nu$ is the scale factor at neutrino decoupling, and $a_{\rm{PMF}}$ is the scale factor at which PMF was generated. The other is the PMF vector mode which peaks at $l \simeq 2000$, with the precise peak position dependent on the PMF spectrum. The vector-mode contribution is independent of $a_{\rm{PMF}}$.

Planck data limit the magnetic field strength to $B_{1 {\rm Mpc}}<4.4$ nanogauss (nG) at the $95\%$ confidence level \cite{Ade:2015cva}. Similar bounds were recently obtained by POLARBEAR \cite{Ade:2015cao} based on their B-mode spectrum alone. A Stage-IV experiment with a $1^\prime$ FWHM and 1.4\,$\mu$K-arcmin polarization sensitivity can improve the $95\%$ CL bound on $B_{1 {\rm Mpc}}$ to 0.6\,nG based on the PMF vector mode contribution to the B-mode spectrum.

Comparable bounds can be obtained from the mode-coupling correlations induced by FR. The mode-coupling is the same as in the case of birefringence discussed in Section~\ref{sec-biref}, with the FR angle depending on frequency as $\nu^{-2}$ \cite{Yadav:2012uz,De:2013dra,Pogosian:2013dya}. Unlike the CMB anisotropies sourced by the stress-energy of the PMF, which scale as a square of the PMF strength (so that the CMB spectra scale as $B^4_{1 {\rm Mpc}}$), the FR contribution is linear in the PMF strength. Thus, despite the fact that the FR angles are typically very small at CMB frequencies, FR offers a significantly larger gain of constraining power with the improved sensitivity and resolution \cite{Pogosian:2013dya} than the PMF sourced vector and tensor mode signatures. A 150-GHz Stage IV experiment can detect mode-coupling correlations sourced by a scale-invariant PMF of 0.6\,nG strength at 95\%CL without any subtraction of the weak lensing B-modes or the Galactic FR contribution. The impact of subtracting the Galactic FR is negligible at PMF strengths above 0.3\,nG \cite{De:2013dra}, however, removing the weak lensing contribution can improve the 95\% CL bound to 0.4\,nG. This will be a significant improvement on the FR based 95\% CL bound of 93\,nG obtained by POLARBEAR  \cite{Ade:2015cao}, based on measurements at 150\,GHz.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
CMB-S4 is an ideal tool to test the inflationary paradigm and competing theories for the origin of structure in the early Universe. Its exquisite sensitivity will allow a detection of degree-scale B-modes in the CMB or achieve upper limits on the amount of B-mode polarization that improve current constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio by over an order of magnitude. In particular, it is sensitive enough to detect the level of B-mode polarization predicted in a wide range of well-motivated inflationary models. In doing so, it would provide invaluable information about physics at energy scales far outside the capabilities of any terrestrial particle physics experiment. In the absence of a detection it would exclude large classes of inflationary models. Furthermore, with sufficient angular resolution, CMB-S4 will measure anisotropies in both the temperature and E-mode polarization of the CMB to cosmic variance limits over the entire range of multipoles that is not contaminated by unresolved foregrounds, and it will extend our window to the early Universe by almost one $e$-fold beyond the reach of current experiments. As a consequence, it will provide the best constraints achievable by any ground-based CMB experiment on any observable that benefits from the number of modes measured, such as the shape of the primordial power spectrum, including the spectral index, its running and the presence of any features, as well as higher-order correlations.
