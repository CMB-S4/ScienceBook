\caption{Plot illustrating the evolution of the raw sensitivity of CMB
  experiments, which scales as the total number of
  bolometers. Ground-based CMB experiments are classified into Stages
  with Stage II experiments having $O$(1000) detectors, Stage III
  experiments having $O$(10,000) detectors, and a Stage IV experiment
  (such as \cmbexp) having $O$(100,000) detectors. Figure from Snowmass  CF5
  Neutrino planning document.}
